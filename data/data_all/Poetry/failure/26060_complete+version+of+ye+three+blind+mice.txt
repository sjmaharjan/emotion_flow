  They made up their minds to set out to roam;
  Said they, "'Tis dull to remain at home,"
  And all the luggage they took was a comb,
    These three Small Mice


  Three Bold Mice

  "Good evening, Host, can you give us a bed?"
  But the Host he grinned and he shook his head;

  So they all slept out in a field instead,
    These three Bold Mice.

  They each had a cold and a swollen face,
  Through sleeping all night in an open space;
  So they rose quite early and left the place,
    These three Cold Mice.

  Searched for some food

  But all they found was a walnut shell
  That lay by the side of a dried-up well;
  Who had eaten the nut they could not tell,
    These three Hungry Mice.

  The Farmer was eating some bread and cheese;
  So they all went down on their hands and knees,
  And squeaked, "Pray, give us a morsel, please,"
    These three Starved Mice.

  They felt so happy they danced with glee;
  But the Farmer's Wife came in to see
  What might this merry-making be
    Of three Glad Mice.

  The Farmer's Wife said, "What are you at,
  And why were you capering round like that?
  Just wait a minute: I'll fetch the Cat"
    Oh dear! Poor Mice.

  They jumped out on to the window ledge;
  The mention of "Cat" set their teeth on edge;
  So they hid themselves in the bramble hedge,
    These three Scared Mice.

  What could they do?

  The bramble hedge was most unkind:
  It scratched their eyes and made them blind,
  And soon each Mouse went out of his mind,
    These three Sad Mice.

    As three Blind Mice?

  They could not see and they had no end;
  They sought a Chemist and found a Friend
  He gave them some "Never too late to mend,"
    These Three Sick Mice.

  And soon their tails began to grow,
  And their eyes recovered their sight, you know;
  They looked in the glass and it told them so.
    These three Wise Mice.

  The name of their house I cannot tell,
  But they've learnt a trade and are doing well.
  If you call upon them, ring the bell
    Three times twice.
