                    Good people all, of every sort,
                      Give ear unto my song;
                    And if you find it wondrous short,
                      It cannot hold you long.

                    In Islington there lived a man,
                      Of whom the world might say,
                    That still a godly race he ran,
                      Whene'er he went to pray.

                    A kind and gentle heart he had,
                      To comfort friends and foes;
                    The naked every day he clad,
                      When he put on his clothes

                    And in that town a dog was found:
                      As many dogs there be--
                    Both mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,
                      And curs of low degree.

                    This dog and man at first were friends;
                      But, when a pique began,
                    The dog, to gain some private ends,
                      Went mad, and bit the man.

                    Around from all the neighbouring streets
                      The wondering neighbours ran;
                    And swore the dog had lost his wits,
                      To bite so good a man.

                    The wound it seem'd both sore and sad
                      To every christian eye;
                    And while they swore the dog was mad,
                      They swore the man would die

                    But soon a wonder came to light,
                      That show'd the rogues they lied--
                    The man recover'd of the bite;
                      The dog it was that died.
