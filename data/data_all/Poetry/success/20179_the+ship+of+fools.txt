Transcriber's note: A few typographical errors in the 1874 introduction
have been corrected: they are listed at the end of the text. In the spirit
of that edition, the text of the Ship of Fools itself has been retained
exactly as it stands, even to the punctuation.

PREFATORY NOTE.

It is necessary to explain that in the present edition of the Ship of
Fools, with a view to both philological and bibliographical interests, the
text, even to the punctuation, has been printed exactly as it stands in the
earlier impression (Pynson's), the authenticity of which Barclay himself
thus vouches for in a deprecatory apology at the end of his labours (II.
330):--

 "... some wordes be in my boke amys
  For though that I my selfe dyd it correct
  Yet with some fautis I knowe it is infect
  Part by my owne ouersyght and neglygence
  And part by the prynters nat perfyte in science

  And other some escaped ar and past
  For that the Prynters in theyr besynes
  Do all theyr workes hedelynge, and in hast"

Yet the differences of reading of the later edition (Cawood's), are
surprisingly few and mostly unimportant, though great pains were evidently
bestowed on the production of the book, all the misprints being carefully
corrected, and the orthography duly adjusted to the fashion of the time.
These differences have, in this edition, been placed in one alphabetical
arrangement with the glossary, by which plan it is believed reference to
them will be made more easy, and much repetition avoided.

The woodcuts, no less valuable for their artistic merit than they are
interesting as pictures of contemporary manners, have been facsimiled for
the present edition from the _originals_ as they appear in the Basle
edition of the Latin, "denuo seduloque reuisa," issued under Brandt's own
superintendence in 1497. This work has been done by Mr J. T. Reid, to whom
it is due to say that he has executed it with the most painstaking and
scrupulous fidelity.

The portrait of Brandt, which forms the frontispiece to this volume, is
taken from Zarncke's edition of the Narrenschiff; that of Barclay
presenting one of his books to his patron, prefixed to the Notice of his
life, appears with a little more detail in the Mirror of Good Manners and
the Pynson editions of the Sallust; it is, however, of no authority, being
used for a similar purpose in various other publications.

For the copy of the extremely rare original edition from which the text of
the present has been printed, I am indebted to the private collection and
the well known liberality of Mr David Laing of the Signet Library, to whom
I beg here to return my best thanks, for this as well as many other
valuable favours in connection with the present work.

In prosecuting enquiries regarding the life of an author of whom so little
is known as of Barclay, one must be indebted for aid, more or less, to the
kindness of friends. In this way I have to acknowledge my obligations to Mr
AEneas Mackay, Advocate, and Mr Ralph Thomas, ("Olphar Hamst"), for searches
made in the British Museum and elsewhere.

For collations of Barclay's Works, other than the Ship of Fools, all of
which are of the utmost degree of rarity, and consequent inaccessibility, I
am indebted to the kindness of Henry Huth, Esq., 30 Princes' Gate,
Kensington; the Rev. W. D. Macray, of the Bodleian Library, Oxford; W. B.
Rye, Esq., of the British Museum; Henry Bradshaw, Esq., of the University
Library, Cambridge; and Professor Skeat, Cambridge.

For my brief notice of Brandt and his Work, it is also proper to
acknowledge my obligations to Zarncke's critical edition of the
Narrenschiff (Leipzig, 1854) which is a perfect encyclopaedia of everything
Brandtian.

INTRODUCTION.

If popularity be taken as the measure of success in literary effort,
Sebastian Brandt's "Ship of Fools" must be considered one of the most
successful books recorded in the whole history of literature. Published in
edition after edition (the first dated 1494), at a time, but shortly after
the invention of printing, when books were expensive, and their circulation
limited; translated into the leading languages of Europe at a time when
translations of new works were only the result of the most signal merits,
its success was then quite unparalleled. It may be said, in modern phrase,
to have been the rage of the reading world at the end of the fifteenth and
throughout the sixteenth centuries. It was translated into Latin by one
Professor (Locher, 1497), and imitated in the same language and under the
same title, by another (Badius Ascensius, 1507); it appeared in Dutch and
Low German, and was twice translated into English, and three times into
French; imitations competed with the original in French and German, as well
as Latin, and greatest and most unprecedented distinction of all, it was
preached, but, we should opine, only certain parts of it, from the pulpit
by the best preachers of the time as a new gospel. The Germans proudly
award it the epithet, "epoch-making," and its long-continued popularity
affords good, if not quite sufficient, ground for the extravagant eulogies
they lavish upon it. Trithemius calls it "Divina Satira," and doubts
whether anything could have been written more suited to the spirit of the
age; Locher compares Brandt with Dante, and Hutten styles him the new
law-giver of German poetry.

A more recent and impartial critic (Mueller, "Chips from a German Workshop,"
Vol. III.), thus suggestively sets forth the varied grounds of Brandt's
wonderful popularity:--"His satires, it is true, are not very powerful, nor
pungent, nor original. But his style is free and easy. Brant is not a
ponderous poet. He writes in short chapters, and mixes his fools in such a
manner that we always meet with a variety of new faces. It is true that all
this would hardly be sufficient to secure a decided success for a work like
his at the present day. But then we must remember the time in which he
wrote.... There was room at that time for a work like the 'Ship of Fools.'
It was the first printed book that treated of contemporaneous events and
living persons, instead of old German battles and French knights. People
are always fond of reading the history of their own times. If the good
qualities of their age are brought out, they think of themselves or their
friends; if the dark features of their contemporaries are exhibited, they
think of their neighbours and enemies. Now the 'Ship of Fools' is just such
a satire which ordinary people would read, and read with pleasure. They
might feel a slight twinge now and then, but they would put down the book
at the end, and thank God that they were not like other men. There is a
chapter on Misers--and who would not gladly give a penny to a beggar? There
is a chapter on Gluttony--and who was ever more than a little exhilarated
after dinner?

There is a chapter on Church-goers--and who ever went to church for
respectability's sake, or to show off a gaudy dress, or a fine dog, or a
new hawk? There is a chapter on Dancing--and who ever danced except for the
sake of exercise? There is a chapter on Adultery--and who ever did more
than flirt with his neighbour's wife? We sometimes wish that Brant's satire
had been a little more searching, and that, instead of his many allusions
to classical fools (for his book is full of scholarship), he had given us a
little more of the _chronique scandaleuse_ of his own time. But he was too
good a man to do this, and his contemporaries were no doubt grateful to him
for his forbearance."

Brandt's satire is a satire for all time. Embodied in the language of the
fifteenth century, coloured with the habits and fashions of the times,
executed after the manner of working of the period, and motived by the
eager questioning spirit and the discontent with "abusions" and "folyes"
which resulted in the Reformation, this satire in its morals or lessons is
almost as applicable to the year of grace 1873 as to the year of
gracelessness 1497. It never can grow old; in the mirror in which the men
of his time saw themselves reflected, the men of all times can recognise
themselves; a crew of "able-bodied" is never wanting to man this old,
weather-beaten, but ever seaworthy vessel. The thoughtful, penetrating,
conscious spirit of the Basle professor passing by, for the most part,
local, temporary or indifferent points, seized upon the never-dying follies
of _human nature_ and impaled them on the printed page for the amusement,
the edification, and the warning of contemporaries and posterity alike. No
petty writer of laborious _vers de societe_ to raise a laugh for a week, a
month, or a year, and to be buried in utter oblivion for ever after, was
he, but a divine seer who saw the weakness and wickedness of the hearts of
men, and warned them to amend their ways and flee from the wrath to come.
Though but a retired student, and teacher of the canon law, a humble-minded
man of letters, and a diffident imperial Counsellor, yet is he to be
numbered among the greatest Evangelists and Reformers of mediaeval Europe
whose trumpet-toned tongue penetrated into regions where the names of
Luther or Erasmus were but an empty sound, if even that. And yet, though
helping much the cause of the Reformation by the freedom of his social and
clerical criticism, by his unsparing exposure of every form of corruption
and injustice, and, not least, by his use of the vernacular for political
and religious purposes, he can scarcely be classed in the great army of the
Protestant Reformers. He was a reformer from within, a biting, unsparing
exposer of every priestly abuse, but a loyal son of the Church, who rebuked
the faults of his brethren, but visited with the pains of Hell those of
"fals herytikes," and wept over the "ruyne, inclynacion, and decay of the
holy fayth Catholyke, and dymynucion of the Empyre."

So while he was yet a reformer in the true sense of the word, he was too
much of the scholar to be anything but a true conservative. To his
scholarly habit of working, as well as to the manner of the time which
hardly trusted in the value of its own ideas but loved to lean them upon
classical authority, is no doubt owing the classical mould in which his
satire is cast. The description of every folly is strengthened by notice of
its classical or biblical prototypes, and in the margin of the Latin
edition of Locher, Brandt himself supplied the citations of the books and
passages which formed the basis of his text, which greatly added to the
popularity of the work. Brandt, indeed, with the modesty of genius,
professes that it is really no more than a collection and translation of
quotations from biblical and classical authors, "Gesamlet durch Sebastianu
Brant." But even admitting the work to be a Mosaic, to adopt the reply of
its latest German editor to the assertion that it is but a compilation
testifying to the most painstaking industry and the consumption of midnight
oil, "even so one learns that a Mosaic is a work of art when executed with
artistic skill." That he caused the classical and biblical passages
flitting before his eyes to be cited in the margin proves chiefly only the
excellence of his memory. They are also before our eyes and yet we are not
always able to answer the question: where, _e.g._, does this occur? ...
Where, _e.g._, occur the following appropriate words of Goethe: "Who can
think anything foolish, who can think anything wise, that antiquity has not
already thought of."

Of the Greek authors, Plutarch only is used, and he evidently by means of a
Latin translation. But from the Latin large draughts of inspiration are
taken, direct from the fountainhead. Ovid, Juvenal, Persius, Catullus, and
Seneca, are largely drawn from, while, strangely enough, Cicero, Boethius,
and Virgil are quoted but seldom, the latter, indeed, only twice, though
his commentators, especially Servetus, are frequently employed. The Bible,
of course, is a never-failing source of illustration, and, as was to be
expected, the Old Testament much more frequently than the New, most use
being made of the Proverbs of Solomon, while Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus,
and the Sapientia follow at no great distance.

The quotations are made apparently direct from the Vulgate, in only a few
cases there being a qualification of the idea by the interpretation of the
Corpus Juris Canonici. But through this medium only, as was to be expected
of the professor of canon law, is the light of the fathers of the Church
allowed to shine upon us, and according to Zarncke (Introduction to his
edition of the Narrenschiff, 1854), use of it has certainly been made far
oftener than the commentary shows, the sources of information of which are
of the most unsatisfactory character. On such solid and tried foundations
did Brandt construct his great work, and the judgment of contemporaries and
posterity alike has declared the superstructure to be worthy of its
supports.

The following admirable notice from Ersch and Grueber (Encyclopaedie) sums up
so skilfully the history, nature, and qualities of the book that we quote
at length:--"The Ship of Fools was received with almost unexampled applause
by high and low, learned and unlearned, in Germany, Switzerland, and
France, and was made the common property of the greatest part of literary
Europe, through Latin, French, English, and Dutch translations. For upwards
of a century it was in Germany a _book of the people_ in the noblest and
widest sense of the word, alike appreciated by an Erasmus and a Reuchlin,
and by the mechanics of Strassburg, Basel, and Augsburg; and it was assumed
to be so familiar to all classes, that even during Brandt's lifetime, the
German preacher Gailer von Kaiserberg went so far as to deliver public
lectures from the pulpit on his friend's poem as if it had been a
scriptural text. As to the poetical and humorous character of Brandt's
poem, its whole conception does not display any extraordinary power of
imagination, nor does it present in its details any very striking sallies
of wit and humour, even when compared with older German works of a similar
kind, such as that of Renner. The fundamental idea of the poem consists in
the shipping off of several shiploads of fools of all kinds for their
native country, which, however, is visible at a distance only; and one
would have expected the poet to have given poetical consistency to his work
by fully carrying out this idea of a ship's crew, and sailing to the 'Land
of Fools.' It is, however, at intervals only that Brandt reminds us of the
allegory; the fools who are carefully divided into classes and introduced
to us in succession, instead of being ridiculed or derided, are reproved in
a liberal spirit, with noble earnestness, true moral feeling, and practical
common sense. It was the straightforward, the bold and liberal spirit of
the poet which so powerfully addressed his contemporaries from the Ship of
the Fools; and to us it is valuable as a product of the piety and morality
of the century which paved the way for the Reformation. Brandt's fools are
represented as contemptible and loathsome rather than _foolish_, and what
he calls follies might be more correctly described as sins and vices.

"The 'Ship of Fools' is written in the dialect of Swabia, and consists of
vigorous, resonant, and rhyming iambic quadrameters. It is divided into 113
sections, each of which, with the exception of a short introduction and two
concluding pieces, treats independently of a certain class of fools or
vicious persons; and we are only occasionally reminded of the fundamental
idea by an allusion to the ship. No folly of the century is left
uncensured. The poet attacks with noble zeal the failings and extravagances
of his age, and applies his lash unsparingly even to the dreaded Hydra of
popery and monasticism, to combat which the Hercules of Wittenberg had not
yet kindled his firebrands. But the poet's object was not merely to reprove
and to animadvert; he instructs also, and shows the fools the way to the
land of wisdom; and so far is he from assuming the arrogant air of the
commonplace moralist, that he reckons himself among the number of fools.
The style of the poem is lively, bold, and simple, and often remarkably
terse, especially in his moral sayings, and renders it apparent that the
author was a classical scholar, without however losing anything of his
German character."

Brandt's humour, which either his earnestness or his manner banished from
the text, took refuge in the illustrations and there disported itself with
a wild zest and vigour. Indeed to their popularity several critics have
ascribed the success of the book, but for this there is no sufficient
authority or probability. Clever as they are, it is more probable that they
ran, in popularity, but an equal race with the text. The precise amount of
Brandt's workmanship in them has not been ascertained, but it is agreed
that "most of them, if not actually drawn, were at least suggested by him."
Zarncke remarks regarding their artistic worth, "not all of the cuts are of
equal value. One can easily distinguish five different workers, and more
practised eyes would probably be able to increase the number. In some one
can see how the outlines, heads, hands, and other principal parts are cut
with the fine stroke of the master, and the details and shading left to the
scholars. The woodcuts of the most superior master, which can be recognized
at once, and are about a third of the whole, belong to the finest, if they
are not, indeed, the finest, which were executed in the fifteenth century,
a worthy school of Holbein. According to the opinion of Herr Rudolph
Weigel, they might possibly be the work of Martin Schoen of Colmar.... The
composition in the better ones is genuinely Hogarth-like, and the longer
one looks at these little pictures, the more is one astonished at the
fulness of the humour, the fineness of the characterisation and the almost
dramatic talent of the grouping." Green, in his recent work on emblems,
characterizes them as marking an epoch in that kind of literature. And
Dibdin, the Macaulay of bibliography, loses his head in admiration of the
"entertaining volume," extolling the figures without stint for "merit in
conception and execution," "bold and free pencilling," "spirit and point,"
"delicacy, truth, and force," "spirit of drollery," &c., &c.; summarising
thus, "few books are more pleasing to the eye, and more gratifying to the
fancy than the early editions of the 'Stultifera Navis.' It presents a
combination of entertainment to which the curious can never be
indifferent."

Whether it were the racy cleverness of the pictures or the unprecedented
boldness of the text, the book stirred Europe of the fifteenth century in a
way and with a rapidity it had never been stirred before. In the German
actual acquaintance with it could then be but limited, though it ran
through seventeen editions within a century; the Latin version brought it
to the knowledge of the educated class throughout Europe; but, expressing,
as it did mainly, the feelings of the common people, to have it in the
learned language was not enough. Translations into various vernaculars were
immediately called for, and the Latin edition having lightened the
translator's labours, they were speedily supplied. England, however, was
all but last in the field but when she did appear, it was in force, with a
version in each hand, the one in prose and the other in verse.

Fifteen years elapsed from the appearance of the first German edition,
before the English metrical version "translated out of Laten, French, and
Doche ... in the colege of Saynt Mary Otery, by me, Alexander Barclay," was
issued from the press of Pynson in 1509. A translation, however, it is not.
Properly speaking, it is an adaptation, an English ship, formed and
fashioned after the Ship of Fools of the World. "But concernynge the
translacion of this boke; I exhort ye reders to take no displesour for y^t,
it is nat translated word by worde acordinge to ye verses of my actour. For
I haue but only drawen into our moder tunge, in rude langage the sentences
of the verses as nere as the parcyte of my wyt wyl suffer me, some tyme
addynge, somtyme detractinge and takinge away suche thinges as semeth me
necessary and superflue. Wherfore I desyre of you reders pardon of my
presumptuous audacite, trustynge that ye shall holde me excused if ye
consyder ye scarsnes of my wyt and my vnexpert youthe. I haue in many
places ouerpassed dyuers poetical digressions and obscurenes of fables and
haue concluded my worke in rude langage as shal apere in my translacion."

"Wylling to redres the errours and vyces of this oure royalme of England
... I haue taken upon me ... the translacion of this present boke ... onely
for the holsome instruccion commodyte and doctryne of wysdome, and to
clense the vanyte and madness of folysshe people of whom ouer great nombre
is in the Royalme of Englonde."

Actuated by these patriotic motives, Barclay has, while preserving all the
valuable characteristics of his original, painted for posterity perhaps the
most graphic and comprehensive picture now preserved of the folly,
injustice, and iniquity which demoralized England, city and country alike,
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and rendered it ripe for any
change political or religious.

 "Knowledge of trouth, prudence, and iust symplicite
  Hath vs clene left; For we set of them no store.
  Our Fayth is defyled loue, goodnes, and Pyte:
  Honest maners nowe ar reputed of: no more.
  Lawyers ar lordes; but Justice is rent and tore.
  Or closed lyke a Monster within dores thre.
  For without mede: or money no man can hyr se.

  Al is disordered: Vertue hath no rewarde.
  Alas, compassion; and mercy bothe ar slayne.
  Alas, the stony hartys of pepyl ar so harde
  That nought can constrayne theyr folyes to refrayne."

His ships are full laden but carry not all who should be on board.

 "We are full lade and yet forsoth I thynke
  A thousand are behynde, whom we may not receyue
  For if we do, our nauy clene shall synke
  He oft all lesys that coueytes all to haue
  From London Rockes Almyghty God vs saue
  For if we there anker, outher bote or barge
  There be so many that they vs wyll ouercharge."

The national tone and aim of the English "Ship" are maintained throughout
with the greatest emphasis, exhibiting an independence of spirit which few
ecclesiastics of the time would have dared to own. Barclay seems to have
been first an Englishman, then an ecclesiastic. Everywhere throughout his
great work the voice of the people is heard to rise and ring through the
long exposure of abuse and injustice, and had the authorship been unknown
it would most certainly have been ascribed to a Langlande of the period.
Everywhere he takes what we would call the popular side, the side of the
people as against those in office. Everywhere he stands up boldly in behalf
of the oppressed, and spares not the oppressor, even if he be of his own
class. He applies the cudgel as vigorously to the priest's pate as to the
Lolardes back. But he disliked modern innovation as much as ancient abuse,
in this also faithfully reflecting the mind of the people, and he is as
emphatic in his censure of the one as in his condemnation of the other.

Barclay's "Ship of Fools," however, is not only important as a picture of
the English life and popular feeling of his time, it is, both in style and
vocabulary, a most valuable and remarkable monument of the English
language. Written midway between Chaucer and Spenser, it is infinitely more
easy to read than either. Page after page, even in the antique spelling of
Pynson's edition, may be read by the ordinary reader of to-day without
reference to a dictionary, and when reference is required it will be found
in nine cases out of ten that the archaism is Saxon, not Latin. This is all
the more remarkable, that it occurs in the case of a priest translating
mainly from the Latin and French, and can only be explained with reference
to his standpoint as a social reformer of the broadest type, and to his
evident intention that his book should be an appeal to all classes, but
especially to the mass of the people, for amendment of their follies. In
evidence of this it may be noticed that in the didactic passages, and
especially in the L'envois, which are additions of his own, wherever, in
fact, he appears in his own character of "preacher," his language is most
simple, and his vocabulary of the most Saxon description.

In his prologue "excusynge the rudenes of his translacion," he professes to
have purposely used the most "comon speche":--

 "My speche is rude my termes comon and rural
  And I for rude peple moche more conuenient
  Than for estates, lerned men, or eloquent."

He afterwards humorously supplements this in "the prologe," by:--

 "But if I halt in meter or erre in eloquence
  Or be to large in langage I pray you blame not me
  For my mater is so bad it wyll none other be."

So much the better for all who are interested in studying the development
of our language and literature. For thus we have a volume, confessedly
written in the commonest language of the common people, from which the
philologist may at once see the stage at which they had arrived in the
development of a simple English speech, and how far, in this respect, the
spoken language had advanced a-head of the written; and from which also he
can judge to what extent the popularity of a book depends, when the
language is in a state of transition, upon the unusual simplicity of its
style both in structure and vocabulary, and how far it may, by reason of
its popularity, be influential in modifying and improving the language in
both these respects. In the long barren tract between Chaucer and Spenser,
the Ship of Fools stands all but alone as a popular poem, and the
continuance of this popularity for a century and more is no doubt to be
attributed as much to the use of the language of the "coming time" as to
the popularity of the subject.

In more recent times however, Barclay has, probably in part, from
accidental circumstances, come to be relegated to a position among the
English classics, those authors whom every one speaks of but few read. That
modern editions of at least his principal performance have not appeared,
can only be accounted for by the great expense attendant upon the
reproduction of so uniquely illustrated a work, an interesting proof of
which, given in the evidence before the Select Committee of the House of
Commons on the Copyright act in 1818, is worth quoting. Amongst new
editions of standard but costly works, of which the tax then imposed by the
act upon publishers of giving eleven copies of all their publications free
to certain libraries prevented the publication, is mentioned, Barclay's
"Ship of Fools;" regarding which Harding, the well known bookseller, is
reported to have said, "We have declined republishing the 'Ship of Fools,'
a folio volume of great rarity and high price. Our probable demand would
not have been more than for a hundred copies, at the price of 12 guineas
each. The delivery of eleven copies to the public libraries decided us
against entering into the speculation."

A wider and more eager interest is now being manifested in our early
literature, and especially in our early popular poetry, to the satisfaction
of which, it is believed, a new edition of this book will be regarded as a
most valuable contribution. Indeed, as a graphic and comprehensive picture
of the social condition of pre-Reformation England; as an important
influence in the formation of our modern English tongue; and as a rich and
unique exhibition of early art, to all of which subjects special attention
is being at present directed, this mediaeval picture-poem is of unrivalled
interest.

Whether this distinguished poet was an Englishman or a Scotchman has long
been a _quaestio vexata_ affording the literary antiquary a suitable field
for the display of his characteristic amenity. Bale, the oldest authority,
simply says that some contend he was a Scot, others an Englishman, (Script.
Illust. Majoris Britt. Catalogus, 1559). Pits (De Illust. Angliae Script.,)
asserts that though to some he appears to have been a Scot, he was really
an Englishman, and probably a native of Devonshire, ("_nam_ ibi ad S.
Mariam de Otery, Presbyter primum fuit"). Wood again, (Athen. Oxon.), by
the reasoning which finds a likeness between Macedon and Monmouth, because
there is a river in each, arrives at "Alexander de Barklay, seems to have
been born at or near a town so called in Somersetshire;" upon which Ritson
pertinently observes, "there is no such place in Somersetshire, the onely
Berkeley known is in Gloucestershire." Warton, coming to the question
double-shotted, observes that "he was most probably of Devonshire or
Gloucestershire," in the one case following Pits, and in the other
anticipating Ritson's observation.

On the other hand Bale, in an earlier work than the _Catalogus_, the
_Summarium Ill. Maj. Britt. Script._, published in 1548, during Barclay's
life time, adorns him with the epithets "Scotus, rhetor ac poeta insignis."
Dempster (Hist. ecclesiastica), styles him "Scotus, ut retulit ipse Joannes
Pitsaeus." Holinshed also styles him "Scot"! Sibbald gives him a place in
his (MS.) Catalogues of Scottish poets, as does also Wodrow in his
Catalogues of Scots writers. Mackenzie (Lives of the Scots writers) begins,
"The Barklies, from whom this gentleman is descended, are of a very ancient
standing in Scotland." Ritson (Bib. Poetica), after a caustic review of the
controversy, observes "both his name of baptism and the orthography of his
surname seem to prove that he was of Scottish extraction." Bliss (Additions
to Wood) is of opinion that he "undoubtedly was not a native of England,"
and Dr Irving (Hist. of Scot. Poetry) adheres to the opinion of Ritson.

Such contention, whatever may be the weight of the evidence on either side,
is at any rate a sufficient proof of the eminence of the individual who is
the subject of it; to be his birthplace being considered an honour of so
much value to the country able to prove its claim to the distinction as to
occasion a literary warfare of several centuries' duration.

We cannot profess to have brought such reinforcements to either side as to
obtain for it a complete and decisive victory, but their number and
character are such as will probably induce one of the combatants quietly to
retire from the field. In the first place, a more explicit and
unimpeachable piece of evidence than any contained in the authors mentioned
above has been found, strangely enough, in a medical treatise, published
about twenty years after Barclay's death, by a physician and botanist of
great eminence in the middle of the sixteenth century, who was a native of
the isle of Ely, at the Monastery of which Barclay was for some time a
monk.

It is entitled "A dialogue both pleasaunt and pietifull, wherein is a
godlie regiment against the Fever Pestilence, with a consolation and
comforte against death.--Newlie corrected by William Bullein, the author
thereof.--Imprinted at London by Ihon Kingston. Julij, 1573." [8vo., B.L.,
111 leaves.] "There was an earlier impression of this work in 1564, but the
edition of 1573 was 'corrected by the author,' the last work on which he
probably was engaged, as he died in 1576. It is of no value at this time of
day as a medical treatise, though the author was very eminent; but we
advert to it because Bullein, for the sake of variety and amusement,
introduces notices of Chaucer, Gower, Lidgate, Skelton, and Barclay, which,
coming from a man who was contemporary with two of them, may be accepted as
generally accurate representations.... Alexander Barclay, Dr Bullein calls
Bartlet, in the irregular spelling of those times; and, asserting that he
was 'born beyond the cold river of Tweed,' we see no sufficient reason for
disbelieving that he was a native of Scotland. Barclay, after writing his
pastorals, &c., did not die until 1552, so that Bullein was his
contemporary, and most likely knew him and the fact. He observes:--'Then
Bartlet, with an hoopyng russet long coate, with a pretie hoode in his
necke, and five knottes upon his girdle, after Francis tricks. He was borne
beyonde the cold river of Twede. He lodged upon a swete bed of chamomill,
under the sinamum tree; about hym many shepherdes and shepe, with
pleasaunte pipes; greatly abhorring the life of Courtiers, Citizens,
Usurers, and Banckruptes, &c., whose olde daies are miserable. And the
estate of shepherdes and countrie people he accoumpted moste happie and
sure." (Collier's "Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature,"
Vol. 1., P. 97).

"The certainty with which Bulleyn here speaks of Barclay, as born beyond
the Tweed, is not a little strengthened by the accuracy with which even in
allegory he delineates his peculiar characteristics. 'He lodged upon a bed
of sweet camomile.' What figure could have been more descriptive of that
agreeable bitterness, that pleasant irony, which distinguishes the author
of the 'Ship of Fools?' 'About him many shepherds and sheep with pleasant
pipes, greatly abhorring the life of courtiers.' What could have been a
plainer paraphrase of the title of Barclay's 'Eclogues,' or 'Miseries of
Courtiers and Courtes, and of all Princes in General.' As a minor feature,
'the five knots upon his girdle after Francis's tricks' may also be
noticed. Hitherto, the fact of Barclay having been a member of the
Franciscan order has been always repeated as a matter of some doubt; 'he
was a monk of the order of St Benedict, and afterwards, as some say, a
Franciscan. Bulleyn knows, and mentions, with certainty, what others only
speak of as the merest conjecture. In short, everything tends to shew a
degree of familiar acquaintance with the man, his habits, and his
productions, which entitles the testimony of Bulleyn to the highest
credit.'" (Lives of the Scottish Poets, Vol. I., pt. ii., p. 77).

But there are other proofs pointing as decidedly to the determination of
this long-continued controversy in favour of Scotland, as the soil from
which this vagrant child of the muses sprung. No evidence seems to have
been hitherto sought from the most obvious source, his writings. The writer
of the memoir in the Biographia Brittanica, (who certainly dealt a
well-aimed, though by no means decisive, blow, in observing, "It is pretty
extraordinary that Barclay himself, in his several addresses to his patrons
should never take notice of his being a stranger, which would have made
their kindness to him the more remarkable [it was very customary for the
writers of that age to make mention in their works of the countries to
which they belonged, especially if they wrote out of their own];[1] whereas
the reader will quickly see, that in his address to the young gentlemen of
England in the 'Mirror of Good Manners,' he treats them as his
countrymen,") has remarked, "It seems a little strange that in those days a
Scot should obtain so great reputation in England, especially if it be
considered from whence our author's rose, viz., from his enriching and
improving the English tongue. Had he written in Latin or on the sciences,
the thing had been probable enough, but in the light in which it now
stands, I think it very far from likely." From which it is evident that the
biographer understood not the versatile nature of the Scot and his ability,
especially when caught young, in "doing in Rome as the Romans do."
Barclay's English education and foreign travel, together extending over the
most impressionable years of his youth, could not have failed to rub off
any obvious national peculiarities of speech acquired in early boyhood, had
the difference between the English and Scottish speech then been wider than
it was. But the language of Barbour and Chaucer was really one and the
same. It will then not be wondered at that but few Scotch words are found
in Barclay's writings. Still, these few are not without their importance in
strengthening the argument as to nationality. The following from "The Ship
of Fools," indicate at once the clime to which they are native, "gree,"
"kest," "rawky," "ryue," "yate," "bokest," "bydeth," "thekt," and "or," in
its peculiar Scottish use.[2] That any Englishman, especially a South or
West of England Englishman, should use words such as those, particularly at
a time of hostility and of little intercourse between the nations, will
surely be admitted to be a far more unlikely thing than that a Scotchman
born, though not bred, should become, after the effects of an English
education and residence had efficiently done their work upon him, a great
improver and enricher of the English tongue.

But perhaps the strongest and most decisive argument of all in this
much-vexed controversy is to be found in the panegyric of James the Fourth
contained in the "Ship of Fools," an eulogy so highly pitched and
extravagant that no Englishman of that time would ever have dreamed of it
or dared to pen it. Nothing could well be more conclusive. Barclay precedes
it by a long and high-flown tribute to Henry, but when he comes to "Jamys
of Scotlonde," he, so to speak, out-Herods Herod. Ordinary verse suffices
not for the greatness of his subject, which he must needs honour with an
acrostic,--

 "I n prudence pereles is this moste comely kynge
  A nd as for his strength and magnanymyte
  C oncernynge his noble dedes in euery thynge
  O ne founde or grounde lyke to hym can not be
  B y byrth borne to boldnes and audacyte
  V nder the bolde planet of Mars the champyon
  S urely to subdue his ennemyes echone."

There, we are convinced, speaks not the prejudiced, Scot-hating English
critic, but the heart beating true to its fatherland and loyal to its
native Sovereign.

That "he was born beyonde the cold river of Twede," about the year 1476, as
shall be shown anon, is however all the length we can go. His training was
without doubt mainly, if not entirely English. He must have crossed the
border very early in life, probably for the purpose of pursuing his
education at one of the Universities, or, even earlier than the period of
his University career, with parents or guardians to reside in the
neighbourhood of Croydon, to which he frequently refers. Croydon is
mentioned in the following passages in Eclogue I.:

 "While I in youth in Croidon towne did dwell."

 "He hath no felowe betwene this and Croidon,
  Save the proude plowman Gnatho of Chorlington."

 "And as in Croidon I heard the Collier preache"

 "Such maner riches the Collier tell thee can"

 "As the riche Shepheard that woned in Mortlake."

It seems to have become a second home to him, for there, we find, in 1552,
he died and was buried.

At which University he studied, whether Oxford or Cambridge, is also a
matter of doubt and controversy. Wood claims him for Oxford and Oriel,
apparently on no other ground than that he dedicates the "Ship of Fools" to
Thomas Cornish, the Suffragan bishop of Tyne, in the Diocese of Bath and
Wells, who was provost of Oriel College from 1493 to 1507. That the Bishop
was the first to give him an appointment in the Church is certainly a
circumstance of considerable weight in favour of the claim of Oxford to be
his _alma mater_, and of Cornish to be his intellectual father; and if the
appointment proceeded from the Provost's good opinion of the young
Scotchman, then it says much for the ability and talents displayed by him
during his College career. Oxford however appears to be nowhere mentioned
in his various writings, while Cambridge is introduced thus in Eclogue
I.:--

 "And once in Cambridge I heard a scoller say."

From which it seems equally, if not more, probable that he was a student at
that university. "There is reason to believe that both the universities
were frequented by Scotish students; many particular names are to be traced
in their annals; nor is it altogether irrelevant to mention that Chaucer's
young clerks of Cambridge who played such tricks to the miller of
Trompington, are described as coming from the north, and as speaking the
Scotish language:--

 'John highte that on, and Alein highte that other,
  Of o toun were they born that highte Strother,
  Fer in the North, I cannot tellen where.'

"It may be considered as highly probable that Barclay completed his studies
in one of those universities, and that the connections which he thus had an
opportunity of forming, induced him to fix his residence in the South; and
when we suppose him to have enjoyed the benefit of an English education it
need not appear peculiarly 'strange, that in those days, a Scot should
obtain so great reputation in England.'" (Irving, Hist. of Scot. Poetry).

In the "Ship" there is a chapter "Of unprofytable Stody" in which he makes
allusion to his student life in such a way as to imply that it had not been
a model of regularity and propriety:

 "The great foly, the pryde, and the enormyte
  Of our studentis, and theyr obstynate errour
  Causeth me to wryte two sentences or thre
  More than I fynde wrytyn in myne actoure
  The tyme hath ben whan I was conductoure
  Of moche foly, whiche nowe my mynde doth greue
  Wherfor of this shyp syns I am gouernoure
  I dare be bolde myne owne vyce to repreue."

If these lines are meant to be accepted literally, which such confessions
seldom are, it may be that he was advised to put a year or two's foreign
travel between his University career, and his entrance into the Church. At
any rate, for whatever reason, on leaving the University, where, as is
indicated by the title of "Syr" prefixed to his name in his translation of
Sallust, he had obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts, he travelled
abroad, whether at his own charges, or in the company of a son of one of
his patrons is not recorded, principally in Germany, Italy, and France,
where he applied himself, with an unusual assiduity and success, to the
acquirement of the languages spoken in those countries and to the study of
their best authors. In the chapter "Of unprofytable Stody," above
mentioned, which contains proof how well he at least had profited by study,
he cites certain continental seats of university learning at each of which,
there is indeed no improbability in supposing he may have remained for some
time, as was the custom in those days:

 "One rennyth to Almayne another vnto France
  To Parys, Padway, Lumbardy or Spayne
  Another to Bonony, Rome, or Orleanse
  To Cayne, to Tolows, Athenys, or Colayne."

Another reference to his travels and mode of travelling is found in the
Eclogues. Whether he made himself acquainted with the English towns he
enumerates before or after his continental travels it is impossible to
determine:

                  CORNIX.

 "As if diuers wayes laye vnto Islington,
  To Stow on the Wold, Quaueneth or Trompington,
  To Douer, Durham, to Barwike or Exeter,
  To Grantham, Totnes, Bristow or good Manchester,
  To Roan, Paris, to Lions or Floraunce.

                  CORIDON.

  (What ho man abide, what already in Fraunce,
  Lo, a fayre iourney and shortly ended to,
  With all these townes what thing haue we to do?

                  CORNIX.

  By Gad man knowe thou that I haue had to do
  In all these townes and yet in many mo,
  To see the worlde in youth me thought was best,
  And after in age to geue my selfe to rest.

                  CORIDON.

  Thou might haue brought one and set by our village.

                  CORNIX.

  What man I might not for lacke of cariage.
  To cary mine owne selfe was all that euer I might,
  And sometime for ease my sachell made I light."
                                ECLOGUE I.

Returning to England, after some years of residence abroad, with his mind
broadened and strengthened by foreign travel, and by the study of the best
authors, modern as well as ancient, Barclay entered the church, the only
career then open to a man of his training. With intellect, accomplishments,
and energy possessed by few, his progress to distinction and power ought to
have been easy and rapid, but it turned out quite otherwise. The road to
eminence lay by the "backstairs," the atmosphere of which he could not
endure. The ways of courtiers--falsehood, flattery, and fawning--he
detested, and worse, he said so, wherefore his learning, wit and eloquence
found but small reward. To his freedom of speech, his unsparing exposure
and denunciation of corruption and vice in the Court and the Church, as
well as among the people generally, must undoubtedly be attributed the
failure to obtain that high promotion his talents deserved, and would
otherwise have met with. The policy, not always a successful one in the
end, of ignoring an inconvenient display of talent, appears to have been
fully carried out in the instance of Barclay.

His first preferment appears to have been in the shape of a chaplainship in
the sanctuary for piety and learning founded at Saint Mary Otery in the
County of Devon, by Grandison, Bishop of Exeter; and to have come from
Thomas Cornish, Suffragan Bishop of Bath and Wells under the title of the
Bishop of Tyne, "meorum primitias laborum qui in lucem eruperunt," to whom,
doubtless out of gratitude for his first appointment, he dedicated "The
Ship of Fools." Cornish, amongst the many other good things he enjoyed,
held, according to Dugdale, from 1490 to 1511, the post of warden of the
College of S. Mary Otery, where Barclay no doubt had formed that regard and
respect for him which is so strongly expressed in the dedication.

A very eulogistic notice of "My Mayster Kyrkham," in the chapter "Of the
extorcion of Knyghtis," (Ship of Fools,) has misled biographers, who were
ignorant of Cornish's connection with S. Mary Otery, to imagine that
Barclay's use of "Capellanus humilimus" in his dedication was merely a
polite expression, and that Kyrkham, of whom he styles himself, "His true
seruytour his chaplayne and bedeman" was his actual ecclesiastical
superior. The following is the whole passage:--

 "Good offycers ar good and commendable
  And manly knyghtes that lyue in rightwysenes
  But they that do nat ar worthy of a bable
  Syns by theyr pryde pore people they oppres
  My mayster Kyrkhan for his perfyte mekenes
  And supportacion of men in pouertye
  Out of my shyp shall worthely be fre

  I flater nat I am his true seruytour
  His chaplayne and his bede man whyle my lyfe shall endure
  Requyrynge God to exalt hym to honour
  And of his Prynces fauour to be sure
  For as I haue sayd I knowe no creature
  More manly rightwyse wyse discrete and sad
  But thoughe he be good, yet other ar als bad."

That this Kyrkham was a knight and not an ecclesiastic is so plainly
apparent as to need no argument. An investigation into Devonshire history
affords the interesting information that among the ancient families of that
county there was one of this name, of great antiquity and repute, now no
longer existent, of which the most eminent member was a certain Sir John
Kirkham, whose popularity is evinced by his having been twice created High
Sheriff of the County, in the years 1507 and 1523. (Prince, Worthies of
Devon; Izacke, Antiquities of Exeter.)

That this was the Kirkham above alluded to, there can be no reasonable
doubt, and in view of the expression "My mayster Kyrkham," it may be
surmised that Barclay had the honour of being appointed by this worthy
gentleman to the office of Sheriff's or private Chaplain or to some similar
position of confidence, by which he gained the poet's respect and
gratitude. The whole allusion, however, might, without straining be
regarded as a merely complimentary one. The tone of the passage affords at
any rate a very pleasing glimpse of the mutual regard entertained by the
poet and his Devonshire neighbours.

After the eulogy of Kyrkham ending with "Yet other ar als bad," the poet
goes on immediately to give the picture of a character of the opposite
description, making the only severe personal reference in his whole
writings, for with all his unsparing exposure of wrong-doing, he carefully,
wisely, honourably avoided personality. A certain Mansell of Otery is
gibbeted as a terror to evil doers in a way which would form a sufficient
ground for an action for libel in these degenerate days.--Ship, II. 82.

 "Mansell of Otery for powlynge of the pore
  Were nat his great wombe, here sholde haue an ore

  But for his body is so great and corporate
  And so many burdens his brode backe doth charge
  If his great burthen cause hym to come to late
  Yet shall the knaue be Captayne of a barge
  Where as ar bawdes and so sayle out at large
  About our shyp to spye about for prayes
  For therupon hath he lyued all his dayes."

It ought however to be mentioned that no such name as Mansell appears in
the Devonshire histories, and it may therefore be fictitious.

The ignorance and reckless living of the clergy, one of the chief objects
of his animadversion, receive also local illustration:

 "For if one can flater, and beare a Hauke on his fist,
  He shalbe made parson of Honington or Clist."

A good humoured reference to the Secondaries of the College is the only
other streak of local colouring we have detected in the Ship, except the
passage in praise of his friend and colleague Bishop, quoted at p. liii.

 "Softe, fooles, softe, a little slacke your pace,
  Till I haue space you to order by degree,
  I haue eyght neyghbours, that first shall haue a place
  Within this my ship, for they most worthy be,
  They may their learning receyue costles and free,
  Their walles abutting and ioyning to the scholes;
  Nothing they can, yet nought will they learne nor see,
  Therfore shall they guide this our ship of fooles."

In the comfort, quiet, and seclusion of the pleasant Devonshire retreat,
the "Ship" was translated in the year 1508, when he would be about
thirty-two, "by Alexander Barclay Preste; and at that tyme chaplen in the
sayde College," whence it may be inferred that he left Devon, either in
that year or the year following, when the "Ship" was published, probably
proceeding to London for the purpose of seeing it through the press.
Whether he returned to Devonshire we do not know; probably not, for his
patron and friend Cornish resigned the wardenship of St Mary Otery in 1511,
and in two years after died, so that Barclay's ties and hopes in the West
were at an end. At any rate we next hear of him in monastic orders, a monk
of the order of S. Benedict, in the famous monastery of Ely, where, as is
evident from internal proof, the Eclogues were written and where likewise,
as appears from the title, was translated "The mirrour of good maners," at
the desire of Syr Giles Alington, Knight.

It is about this period of his life, probably the period of the full bloom
of his popularity, that the quiet life of the poet and priest was
interrupted by the recognition of his eminence in the highest quarters, and
by a request for his aid in maintaining the honour of the country on an
occasion to which the eyes of all Europe were then directed. In a letter of
Sir Nicholas Vaux, busied with the preparations for the meeting of Henry
VIII., and Francis I., called the Field of the Cloth of Gold, to Wolsey, of
date 10th April 1520, he begs the cardinal to "send to them ... Maistre
Barkleye, the Black Monke and Poete, to devise histoires and convenient
raisons to florisshe the buildings and banquet house withal" (Rolls
Calendars of Letters and Papers, Henry VIII., III. pt. 1.). No doubt it was
also thought that this would be an excellent opportunity for the eulogist
of the Defender of the Faith to again take up the lyre to sing the glories
of his royal master, but no effort of his muse on the subject of this great
chivalric pageant has descended to us if any were ever penned.

Probably after this employment he did not return to Ely; with his position
or surroundings there he does not seem to have been altogether satisfied
("there many a thing is wrong," see p. lxix.); and afterwards, though in
the matter of date we are somewhat puzzled by the allusion of Bulleyn, an
Ely man, to his Franciscan habit, he assumed the habit of the Franciscans
at Canterbury, ('Bale MS. Sloan, f. 68,') to which change we may owe, if it
be really Barclay's, "The life of St Thomas of Canterbury."

Autumn had now come to the poet, but fruit had failed him. The advance of
age and his failure to obtain a suitable position in the Church began
gradually to weigh upon his spirits. The bright hopes with which he had
started in the flush of youth, the position he was to obtain, the influence
he was to wield, and the work he was to do personally, and by his writings,
in the field of moral and social reformation were all in sad contrast with
the actualities around. He had never risen from the ranks, the army was in
a state of disorganisation, almost of mutiny, and the enemy was more bold,
unscrupulous, and numerous than ever. It is scarcely to be wondered at
that, though not past fifty, he felt prematurely aged, that his youthful
enthusiasm which had carried him on bravely in many an attempt to instruct
and benefit his fellows at length forsook him and left him a prey to that
weakness of body, and that hopelessness of spirit to which he so
pathetically alludes in the Prologue to the Mirror of good Manners. All his
best work, all the work which has survived to our day, was executed before
this date. But the pen was too familiar to his hand to be allowed to drop.
His biographers tell us "that when years came on he spent his time mostly
in pious matters, and in reading and writing histories of the Saints." A
goodly picture of a well-spent old age. The harness of youth he had no
longer the spirit and strength to don, the garments of age he gathered
resignedly and gracefully about him.

On the violent dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, when their inmates,
the good and bad, the men of wisdom and the "fools," were alike cast adrift
upon a rock-bound and stormy coast, the value of the patronage which his
literary and personal popularity had brought him, was put to the test, and
in the end successfully, though after considerable, but perhaps not to be
wondered at, delay. His great patrons, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of
Kent, Bishop Cornish, and probably also Sir Giles Alington, were all dead,
and he had to rely on newer and necessarily weaker ties. But after waiting,
till probably somewhat dispirited, fortune smiled at last. Two handsome
livings were presented to him in the same year, both of which he apparently
held at the same time, the vicarage of Much Badew in Essex, by the
presentation of Mr John Pascal, to which he was instituted on February 7th,
1546, holding it (according to the Lansdowne MS. (980 f. 101), in the
British Museum) till his death; and the vicarage of S. Mathew at Wokey, in
Somerset, on March 30th of the same year. Wood dignifies him with the
degree of doctor of divinity at the time of his presentation to these
preferments.

That he seems to have accepted quietly the gradual progress of the reformed
religion during the reign of Edward VI., has been a cause of wonder to
some. It would certainly have been astonishing had one who was so unsparing
in his exposure of the flagrant abuses of the Romish Church done otherwise.
Though personally disinclined to radical changes his writings amply show
his deep dissatisfaction with things as they were. This renders the more
improbable the honours assigned him by Wadding (Scriptores Ordinis Minorum,
1806, p. 5), who promotes him to be Suffragan Bishop of Bath and Wells, and
Bale, who, in a slanderous anecdote, the locale of which is also Wells,
speaks of him as a chaplain of Queen Mary's, though Mary did not ascend the
throne till the year after his death. As these statements are nowhere
confirmed, it is not improbable that their authors have fallen into error
by confounding the poet Barclay, with a Gilbert Berkeley, who became Bishop
of Bath and Wells in 1559. One more undoubted, but tardy, piece of
preferment was awarded him which may be regarded as an honour of some
significance. On the 30th April 1552, the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury,
London, presented him to the Rectory of All Hallows, Lombard Street, but
the well-deserved promotion came too late to be enjoyed. A few weeks after,
and before the 10th June, at which date his will was proved, he died, as
his biographers say, "at a very advanced age;" at the good old age of
seventy-six, as shall be shown presently, at Croydon where he had passed
his youth, and there in the Church he was buried. "June 10th 1552,
Alexander Barkley sepult," (Extract from the Parish Register, in Lyson's
Environs of London).

A copy of his will, an extremely interesting and instructive document, has
been obtained from Doctors' Commons, and will be found appended. It bears
in all its details those traits of character which, from all that we
otherwise know, we are led to associate with him. In it we see the earnest,
conscientious minister whose first thought is of the poor, the loyal
churchman liberal in his support of the house of God, the kind relative in
his numerous and considerate bequests to his kith and kin, the amiable,
much loved man in the gifts of remembrance to his many friends, and the
pious Christian in his wishes for the prayers of his survivors "to
Almightie God for remission of my synnes, and mercy upon my soule."

Barclay's career and character, both as a churchman and a man of letters,
deserve attention and respect from every student of our early history and
literature. In the former capacity he showed himself diligent, honest, and
anxious, at a time when these qualities seemed to have been so entirely
lost to the church as to form only a subject for clerical ridicule. In the
latter, the same qualities are also prominent, diligence, honesty, bold
outspokenness, an ardent desire for the pure, the true, and the natural,
and an undisguised enmity to everything false, self-seeking, and vile.
Everything he did was done in a pure way, and to a worthy end.

Bale stands alone in casting aspersions upon his moral character,
asserting, as Ritson puts it, "in his bigoted and foul-mouthed way," that
"he continued a hater of truth, and under the disguise of celibacy a filthy
adulterer to the last;" and in his Declaration of Bonner's articles (1561,
fol. 81), he condescends to an instance to the effect that "Doctoure
Barkleye hadde greate harme ones of suche a visitacion, at Wellys, before
he was Quene Maryes Chaplayne. For the woman whome he so religiouslye
visited did light him of all that he had, sauinge his workinge tolas. For
the whiche acte he had her in prison, and yet coulde nothing recouer
againe." Whether this story be true of any one is perhaps doubtful, and, if
true of a Barclay, we are convinced that he is not our author. It may have
arisen as we have seen from a mistake as to identity. But apart from the
question of identity, we have nothing in support of the slander but Bale's
"foul-mouthed" assertion, while against it we have the whole tenor and aim
of Barclay's published writings. Everywhere he inculcates the highest and
purest morality, and where even for that purpose he might be led into
descriptions of vice, his disgust carries him past what most others would
have felt themselves justified in dealing with. For example, in the chapter
of "Disgysyd folys" he expressly passes over as lightly as possible what
might to others have proved a tempting subject:

 "They disceyue myndes chaste and innocent
  With dyuers wayes whiche I wyll nat expres
  Lyst that whyle I labour this cursyd gyse to stynt
  I myght to them mynyster example of lewdnes
  And therfore in this part I shall say les
  Than doth my actour."

Elsewhere he declares:

                 "for my boke certaynly
  I haue compyled: for vertue and goodnes
  And to reuyle foule synne and vyciousnes"

But citation is needless; there is not a page of his writings which will
not supply similar evidence, and our great early moralist may, we think, be
dismissed from Court without a stain on his character.

Indeed to his high pitched morality, he doubtless owed in some degree the
great and extended popularity of his poetical writings in former times and
their neglect in later. Sermons and "good" books were not yet in the
sixteenth century an extensive branch of literature, and "good" people
could without remorse of conscience vary their limited theological reading
by frowning over the improprieties and sins of their neighbours as depicted
in the "Ship," and joining, with a serious headshaking heartiness, in the
admonitions of the translator to amendment, or they might feel
"strengthened" by a glance into the "Mirrour of good Maners," or edified by
hearing of the "Miseryes of Courtiers and Courtes of all princes in
generall," as told in the "Eclogues."

Certain it is that these writings owed little of their acceptance to
touches of humour or satire, to the gifts of a poetical imagination, or the
grace of a polished diction. The indignation of the honest man and the
earnestness of the moralist waited not for gifts and graces. Everything
went down, hard, rough, even uncouth as it stood, of course gaining in
truth and in graphic power what it wants in elegance. Still, with no
refinement, polish or elaboration, there are many picturesque passages
scattered throughout these works which no amount of polishing could have
improved. How could a man in a rage be better touched off than thus ("Ship"
I. 182, 15).

 "This man malycious whiche troubled is with wrath
  Nought els soundeth but the hoorse letter R."

The passion of love is so graphically described that it is difficult to
imagine our priestly moralist a total stranger to its power, (I. 81).

 "For he that loueth is voyde of all reason
  Wandrynge in the worlde without lawe or mesure
  In thought and fere sore vexed eche season
  And greuous dolours in loue he must endure
  No creature hym selfe, may well assure
  From loues soft dartis: I say none on the grounde
  But mad and folysshe bydes he whiche hath the wounde

  Aye rennynge as franatyke no reason in his mynde
  He hath no constaunce nor ease within his herte
  His iyen ar blynde, his wyll alwaye inclyned
  To louys preceptes yet can nat he departe
  The Net is stronge, the sole caught can nat starte
  The darte is sharpe, who euer is in the chayne
  Can nat his sorowe in vysage hyde nor fayne"

For expressive, happy simile, the two following examples are capital:--

 "Yet sometimes riches is geuen by some chance
  To such as of good haue greatest aboundaunce.
  Likewise as streames unto the sea do glide.
  But on bare hills no water will abide.
      .    .    .    .    .    .
  So smallest persons haue small rewarde alway
  But men of worship set in authoritie
  Must haue rewardes great after their degree."--ECLOGUE I.

 "And so such thinges which princes to thee geue
  To thee be as sure as water in a siue
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  So princes are wont with riches some to fede
  As we do our swine when we of larde haue nede
  We fede our hogges them after to deuour
  When they be fatted by costes and labour."--ECLOGUE I.

The everlasting conceit of musical humanity is very truthfully hit off.

 "This is of singers the very propertie
  Alway they coueyt desired for to be
  And when their frendes would heare of their cunning
  Then are they neuer disposed for to sing,
  But if they begin desired of no man
  Then shewe they all and more then they can
  And neuer leaue they till men of them be wery,
  So in their conceyt their cunning they set by."--ECLOGUE II.

Pithy sayings are numerous. Comparing citizens with countrymen, the
countryman says:--

 "Fortune to them is like a mother dere
  As a stepmother she doth to us appeare."

Of money:

 "Coyne more than cunning exalteth every man."

Of clothing:

 "It is not clothing can make a man be good
  Better is in ragges pure liuing innocent
  Than a soule defiled in sumptuous garment."

It is as the graphic delineator of the life and condition of the country in
his period that the chief interest of Barclay's writings, and especially of
the "Ship of Fools," now lies. Nowhere so accessibly, so fully, and so
truthfully will be found the state of Henry the Eighth's England set forth.
Every line bears the character of truthfulness, written as it evidently is,
in all the soberness of sadness, by one who had no occasion to exaggerate,
whose only object and desire was, by massing together and describing
faithfully the follies and abuses which were evident to all, to shame every
class into some degree of moral reformation, and, in particular, to effect
some amelioration of circumstances to the suffering poor.

And a sad picture it is which we thus obtain of merrie England in the good
old times of bluff King Hal, wanting altogether in the _couleur de rose_
with which it is tinted by its latest historian Mr Froude, who is ably
taken to task on this subject by a recent writer in the Westminster Review,
whose conclusions, formed upon other evidence than Barclay's, express so
fairly the impression left by a perusal of the "Ship of Fools," and the
Eclogues, that we quote them here. "Mr Froude remarks: 'Looking therefore,
at the state of England as a whole, I cannot doubt that under Henry the
body of the people were prosperous, well-fed, loyal, and contented. In all
points of material comfort, they were as well off as ever they had been
before; better off than they have ever been in later times.' In this
estimate we cannot agree. Rather we should say that during, and for long
after, this reign, the people were in the most deplorable condition of
poverty and misery of every kind. That they were ill-fed, that loyalty was
at its lowest ebb, that discontent was rife throughout the land. 'In all
points of material comfort,' we think they were worse off than they had
ever been before, and infinitely worse off than they have ever been since
the close of the sixteenth century,--a century in which the cup of
England's woes was surely fuller than it has ever been since, or will, we
trust, ever be again. It was the century in which this country and its
people passed through a baptism of blood as well as 'a baptism of fire,'
and out of which they came holier and better. The epitaph which should be
inscribed over the century is contained in a sentence written by the famous
Acham in 1547:--'Nam vita, quae nunc vivitur a plurimis, non vita sed
miseria est.'" So, Bradford (Sermon on Repentance, 1533) sums up
contemporary opinion in a single weighty sentence: "All men may see if they
will that the whoredom pride, unmercifulness, and tyranny of England far
surpasses any age that ever was before." Every page of Barclay corroborates
these accounts of tyranny, injustice, immorality, wretchedness, poverty,
and general discontent.

Not only in fact and feeling are Barclay's Ship of Fools and Eclogues
thoroughly expressive of the unhappy, discontented, poverty-stricken,
priest-ridden, and court-ridden condition and life, the bitter sorrows and
the humble wishes of the people, their very texture, as Barclay himself
tells us, consists of the commonest language of the day, and in it are
interwoven many of the current popular proverbs and expressions. Almost all
of these are still "household words" though few ever imagine the garb of
their "daily wisdom" to be of such venerable antiquity. Every page of the
"Eclogues" abounds with them; in the "Ship" they are less common, but still
by no means infrequent. We have for instance:--

 "Better is a frende in courte than a peny in purse"--(I. 70.)
 "Whan the stede is stolyn to shyt the stable dore"--(I. 76.)
 "It goeth through as water through a syue."--(I. 245.)
 "And he that alway thretenyth for to fyght
  Oft at the prose is skantly worth a hen
  For greattest crakers ar nat ay boldest men."--(I. 198.)
 "I fynde foure thynges whiche by no meanes can
  Be kept close, in secrete, or longe in preuetee
  The firste is the counsell of a wytles man
  The seconde is a cyte whiche byldyd is a hye
  Upon a montayne the thyrde we often se
  That to hyde his dedes a louer hath no skyll
  The fourth is strawe or fethers on a wyndy hyll."--(I. 199.)
 "A crowe to pull."--(II. 8.)
 "For it is a prouerbe, and an olde sayd sawe
  That in euery place lyke to lyke wyll drawe."--(II. 35.)
 "Better haue one birde sure within thy wall
  Or fast in a cage than twenty score without"--(II. 74)
 "Gapynge as it were dogges for a bone."--(II. 93.)
 "Pryde sholde haue a fall."--(II. 161).
 "For wyse men sayth ...
  One myshap fortuneth neuer alone."
 "Clawe where it itchyth."--(II. 256.) [The use of this, it occurs again in
     the Eclogues, might be regarded by some of our Southern friends, as
     itself a sufficient proof of the author's Northern origin.]

The following are selected from the Eclogues as the most remarkable:

 "Each man for himself, and the fende for us all."
 "They robbe Saint Peter therwith to clothe Saint Powle."
 "For might of water will not our leasure bide."
 "Once out of sight and shortly out of minde."
 "For children brent still after drede the fire."
 "Together they cleave more fast than do burres."
 "Tho' thy teeth water."
 "I aske of the foxe no farther than the skin."
 "To touche soft pitche and not his fingers file."
 "From post unto piller tost shall thou be."
 "Over head and eares."
 "Go to the ant."
 "A man may contende, God geueth victory."
 "Of two evils chose the least."

These are but the more striking specimens. An examination of the "Ship,"
and especially of the "Eclogues," for the purpose of extracting their whole
proverbial lore, would be well worth the while, if it be not the duty, of
the next collector in this branch of popular literature. These writings
introduce many of our common sayings for the first time to English
literature, no writer prior to Barclay having thought it dignified or worth
while to profit by the popular wisdom to any perceptible extent. The first
collection of proverbs, Heywood's, did not appear until 1546, so that in
Barclay we possess the earliest known English form of such proverbs as he
introduces. It need scarcely be said that that form is, in the majority of
instances, more full of meaning and point than its modern representatives.

Barclay's adoption of the language of the people naturally elevated him in
popular estimation to a position far above that of his contemporaries in
the matter of style, so much so that he has been traditionally recorded as
one of the greatest improvers of the language, that is, one of those who
helped greatly to bring the written language to be more nearly in
accordance with the spoken. Both a scholar and a man of the world, his
phraseology bears token of the greater cultivation and wider knowledge he
possessed over his contemporaries. He certainly aimed at clearness of
expression, and simplicity of vocabulary, and in these respects was so far
in advance of his time that his works can even now be read with ease,
without the help of dictionary or glossary. In spite of his church training
and his residence abroad, his works are surprisingly free from Latin or
French forms of speech; on the contrary, they are, in the main,
characterised by a strong Saxon directness of expression which must have
tended greatly to the continuance of their popularity, and have exercised a
strong and advantageous influence both in regulating the use of the common
spoken language, and in leading the way which it was necessary for the
literary language to follow. Philologists and dictionary makers appear,
however, to have hitherto overlooked Barclay's works, doubtless owing to
their rarity, but their intrinsic value as well as their position in
relation to the history of the language demand specific recognition at
their hands.

Barclay evidently delighted in his pen. From the time of his return from
the Continent, it was seldom out of his hand. Idleness was distasteful to
him. He petitions his critics if they be "wyse men and cunnynge," that:--

 "They shall my youth pardone, and vnchraftynes
  Whiche onely translate, to eschewe ydelnes."

Assuredly a much more laudable way of employing leisure then than now,
unless the translator prudently stop short of print. The modesty and
singleness of aim of the man are strikingly illustrated by his thus
devoting his time and talents, not to original work as he was well able to
have done had he been desirous only of glorifying his own name, but to the
translation and adaptation or, better, "Englishing" of such foreign authors
as he deemed would exercise a wholesome and profitable influence upon his
countrymen. Such work, however, moulded in his skilful hands, became all
but original, little being left of his author but the idea. Neither the
Ship of Fools, nor the Eclogues retain perceptible traces of a foreign
source, and were it not that they honestly bear their authorship on their
fore-front, they might be regarded as thoroughly, even characteristically,
English productions.

The first known work from Barclay's pen[3] appeared from the press of De
Worde, so early as 1506, probably immediately on his return from abroad,
and was no doubt the fruit of continental leisure. It is a translation, in
seven line stanzas, of the popular French poet Pierre Gringore's Le Chateau
de labour (1499)--the most ancient work of Gringore with date, and perhaps
his best--under the title of "The Castell of laboure wherein is richesse,
vertu, and honour;" in which in a fanciful allegory of some length, a
somewhat wearisome Lady Reason overcomes despair, poverty and other such
evils attendant upon the fortunes of a poor man lately married, the moral
being to show:--

 "That idleness, mother of all adversity,
  Her subjects bringeth to extreme poverty."

The general appreciation of this first essay is evidenced by the issue of a
second edition from the press of Pynson a few years after the appearance of
the first.

Encouraged by the favourable reception accorded to the first effort of his
muse, Barclay, on his retirement to the ease and leisure of the College of
St Mary Otery, set to work on the "Ship of Fools," acquaintance with which
Europe-famous satire he must have made when abroad. This, his _magnum
opus_, has been described at some length in the Introduction, but two
interesting personal notices relative to the composition of the work may
here be added. In the execution of the great task, he expresses himself,
(II. 278), as under the greatest obligations to his colleague, friend, and
literary adviser, Bishop:--

 "Whiche was the first ouersear of this warke
  And vnto his frende gaue his aduysement
  It nat to suffer to slepe styll in the darke
  But to be publysshyd abrode: and put to prent
  To thy monycion my bysshop I assent
  Besechynge god that I that day may se
  That thy honour may prospere and augment
  So that thy name and offyce may agre
      .    .    .    .    .    .
  In this short balade I can nat comprehende
  All my full purpose that I wolde to the wryte
  But fayne I wolde that thou sholde sone assende
  To heuenly worshyp and celestyall delyte
  Than shoulde I after my pore wyt and respyt,
  Display thy name, and great kyndnes to me
  But at this tyme no farther I indyte
  But pray that thy name and worshyp may agre."

Pynson, in his capacity of judicious publisher, fearing lest the book
should exceed suitable dimensions, also receives due notice at p. 108 of
Vol. I., where he speaks of

         "the charge Pynson hathe on me layde
  With many folys our Nauy not to charge."

The concluding stanza, or colophon, is also devoted to immortalising the
great bibliopole in terms, it must be admitted, not dissimilar to those of
a modern draper's poet laureate:--

  Our Shyp here leuyth the sees brode
  By helpe of God almyght and quyetly
  At Anker we lye within the rode
  But who that lysteth of them to bye
  In Flete strete shall them fynde truly
  At the George: in Richarde Pynsonnes place
  Prynter vnto the Kynges noble grace.
                      Deo gratias.

Contemporary allusions to the Ship of Fools there could not fail to be, but
the only one we have met with occurs in Bulleyn's Dialogue quoted above, p.
xxvii. It runs as follows:--_Uxor_.--What ship is that with so many owers,
and straunge tacle; it is a greate vessell. _Ciuis_.--This is the ship of
fooles, wherin saileth bothe spirituall and temporall, of euery callyng
some: there are kynges, queenes, popes, archbishoppes, prelates, lordes,
ladies, knightes, gentlemen, phisicions, lawiers, marchauntes,
housbandemen, beggers, theeues, hores, knaues, &c. This ship wanteth a good
pilot: the storme, the rocke, and the wrecke at hande, all will come to
naught in this hulke for want of good gouernement.

The Eclogues, as appears from their Prologue, had originally been the work
of our author's youth, "the essays of a prentice in the art of poesie," but
they were wisely laid past to be adorned by the wisdom of a wider
experience, and were, strangely enough, lost for years until, at the age of
thirty-eight, the author again lighted, unexpectedly, upon his lost
treasures, and straightway finished them off for the public eye.

The following autobiographical passage reminds one forcibly of Scott's
throwing aside Waverley, stumbling across it after the lapse of years, and
thereupon deciding at once to finish and publish it. After enumerating the
most famous eclogue writers, he proceeds:--

 "Nowe to my purpose, their workes worthy fame,
  Did in my yonge age my heart greatly inflame,
  Dull slouth eschewing my selfe to exercise,
  In such small matters, or I durst enterprise,
  To hyer matter, like as these children do,
  Which first vse to creepe, and afterwarde to go.
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  So where I in youth a certayne worke began,
  And not concluded, as oft doth many a man:
  Yet thought I after to make the same perfite,
  But long I missed that which I first did write.
  But here a wonder, I fortie yere saue twayne,
  Proceeded in age, founde my first youth agayne.
  To finde youth in age is a probleme diffuse,
  But nowe heare the truth, and then no longer muse.
  As I late turned olde bookes to and fro,
  One litle treatise I founde among the mo
  Because that in youth I did compile the same,
  Egloges of youth I did call it by name.
  And seing some men haue in the same delite,
  At their great instance I made the same perfite,
  Adding and bating where I perceyued neede,
  All them desiring which shall this treatise rede,
  Not to be grieued with any playne sentence,
  Rudely conuayed for lacke of eloquence."

The most important revelation in the whole of this interesting passage,
that relating to the author's age, seems to have been studiously overlooked
by all his biographers. If we can fix with probability the date at which
these Eclogues were published, then this, one of the most regretted of the
lacunae in his biography, will be supplied. We shall feel henceforth
treading on firmer ground in dealing with the scanty materials of his life.

From the length and favour with which the praises of the Ely Cathedral and
of Alcock its pious and munificent bishop, then but recently dead, are sung
in these poems (see p. lxviii.), it is evident that the poet must have
donned the black hood in the monastery of Ely for at least a few years.

Warton fixes the date at 1514, because of the praises of the "noble Henry
which now departed late," and the after panegyric of his successor Henry
VIII. (Eclogue I.), whose virtues are also duly recorded in the Ship of
Fools (I. 39 and II. 205-8), but not otherwise of course than in a
complimentary manner. Our later lights make this picture of the noble pair
appear both out of drawing and over-coloured:--

 "Beside noble Henry which nowe departed late,
  Spectacle of vertue to euery hye estate,
  The patrone of peace and primate of prudence,
  Which on Gods Church hath done so great expence.
  Of all these princes the mercy and pitie,
  The loue of concorde, iustice and equitie,
  The purenes of life and giftes liberall,
  Not lesse vertuous then the said princes all.
  And Henry the eyght moste hye and triumphant,
  No gifte of vertue nor manlines doth want,
  Mine humble spech and language pastorall
  If it were able should write his actes all:
  But while I ought speake of courtly misery,
  Him with all suche I except vtterly.
  But what other princes commonly frequent,
  As true as I can to shewe is mine intent,
  But if I should say that all the misery,
  Which I shall after rehearse and specify
  Were in the court of our moste noble kinge,
  I should fayle truth, and playnly make leasing."--ECLOGUE I.

This eulogy of Henry plainly implies some short experience of his reign.
But other allusions contribute more definitely to fix the precise date,
such as the following historical passage, which evidently refers to the
career of the notorious extortioners, Empson and Dudley, who were executed
for conspiracy and treason in the first year of the new king's reign.

 "Such as for honour unto the court resort,
  Looke seldome times upon the lower sort;
  To the hyer sort for moste part they intende,
  For still their desire is hyer to ascende
  And when none can make with them comparison,
  Against their princes conspire they by treason,
  Then when their purpose can nat come well to frame,
  Agayne they descende and that with utter shame,
  Coridon thou knowest right well what I meane,
  We lately of this experience haue seene
  When men would ascende to rowmes honorable
  Euer is their minde and lust insaciable."

The most definite proof of the date of publication, however, is found in
the fourth Eclogue. It contains a long poem called The towre of vertue and
honour, which is really a highly-wrought elegy on the premature and
glorious death, not of "the Duke of Norfolk, Lord High admiral, and one of
Barclay's patrons," as has been repeated parrot-like, from Warton
downwards, but of his chivalrous son, Sir Edward Howard, Lord High Admiral
for the short space of a few months, who perished in his gallant, if
reckless, attack upon the French fleet in the harbour of Brest in the year
1513. It is incomprehensible that the date of the publication of the
Eclogues should be fixed at 1514, and this blunder still perpetuated. No
Duke of Norfolk died between Barclay's boyhood and 1524, ten years after
the agreed upon date of the Elegy; and the Duke (Thomas), who was Barclay's
patron, never held the position of Lord High Admiral (though his son Lord
Thomas, created Earl of Surrey in 1514, and who afterwards succeeded him,
also succeeded his brother Sir Edward in the Admiralship), but worthily
enjoyed the dignified offices of Lord High Steward, Lord Treasurer, and
Earl Marshal, and died one of Henry's most respected and most popular
Ministers, at his country seat, at a good old age, in the year above
mentioned, 1524. The other allusions to contemporary events, and especially
to the poet's age, preclude the idea of carrying forward the publication to
the latter date, did the clearly defined points of the Elegy allow of it,
as they do not.

Minalcas, one of the interlocutors, thus introduces the subject:--

                     "But it is lamentable
  To heare a Captayne so good and honorable,
  _So soone_ withdrawen by deathes crueltie,
  Before his vertue was at moste hye degree.
  If death for a season had shewed him fauour,
  To all his nation he should haue bene honour."

"'The Towre of Vertue and Honor,' introduced as a song of one of the
shepherds into these pastorals, exhibits no very masterly strokes of a
sublime and inventive fancy. It has much of the trite imagery usually
applied in the fabrication of these ideal edifices. It, however, shows our
author in a new walk of poetry. This magnificent tower, or castle is built
on inaccessible cliffs of flint: the walls are of gold, bright as the sun,
and decorated with 'olde historyes and pictures manyfolde:' the turrets are
beautifully shaped. Among its heroic inhabitants are Henry VIII., ['in his
maiestie moste hye enhaunsed as ought a conquerour,' no doubt an allusion
to the battle of the Spurs and his other exploits in France in 1513],
Howard Duke of Norfolk, ['the floure of chiualry'], and the Earl of
Shrewsbury, ['manfull and hardy, with other princes and men of dignitie'].
Labour is the porter at the gate, and Virtue governs the house. Labour is
thus pictured, with some degree of spirit:--

   'Fearefull is labour without fauour at all,
    Dreadfull of visage, a monster intreatable,
  Like Cerberus lying at gates infernall;
    To some men his looke is halfe intollerable,
  His shoulders large, for burthen strong and able,
    His body bristled, his necke mightie and stiffe;
  By sturdy senewes, his ioyntes stronge and stable,
    Like marble stones his handes be as stiffe.

  Here must man vanquishe the dragon of Cadmus,
    Against the Chimer here stoutly must he fight,
  Here must he vanquish the fearefull Pegasus,
    For the golden flece here must he shewe his might:
  If labour gaynsay, he can nothing be right,
    This monster labour oft chaungeth his figure,
  Sometime an oxe, a bore, or lion wight,
    Playnely he seemeth, thus chaungeth his nature,

    Like as Protheus ofte chaunged his stature.
        .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  Under his browes he dreadfully doth loure,
    With glistering eyen, and side dependaunt beard,
  For thirst and hunger alway his chere is soure.
    His horned forehead doth make faynt heartes feard.

  Alway he drinketh, and yet alway is drye,
    The sweat distilling with droppes aboundaunt,'
        .    .    .    .    .    .    .

"The poet adds, 'that when the noble Howard had long boldly contended with
this hideous monster, had broken the bars and doors of the castle, had
bound the porter, and was now preparing to ascend the tower of Virtue and
Honour, Fortune and Death appeared, and interrupted his progress.'"
(Warton, Eng. Poetry, III.)

The hero's descent and knightly qualities are duly set forth:--

 "Though he were borne to glory and honour,
  Of auncient stocke and noble progenie,
  Yet thought his courage to be of more valour,
  By his owne actes and noble chiualry.
  Like as becommeth a knight to fortifye
  His princes quarell with right and equitie,
  So did this Hawarde with courage valiauntly,
  Till death abated his bolde audacitie."

The poet, gives "cursed fortune" a severe rating, and at such length that
the old lady no doubt repented herself, for cutting off so promising a hero
_at so early an age_:--

 "Tell me, frayle fortune, why did thou breuiate
  The liuing season of suche a captayne,
  That when his actes ought to be laureate
  Thy fauour turned him suffring to be slayne?"

And then he addresses the Duke himself in a consolatory strain,
endeavouring to reconcile him to the loss of so promising a son, by
recalling to his memory those heroes of antiquity whose careers of glory
were cut short by sudden and violent deaths:--

 "But moste worthy duke hye and victorious,
  Respire to comfort, see the vncertentie
  Of other princes, whose fortune prosperous
  Oftetime haue ended in hard aduersitie:
  Read of Pompeius," [&c.]
      .    .    .    .    .    .
 "This shall be, this is, and this hath euer bene,
  That boldest heartes be nearest ieopardie,
  To dye in battayle is honour as men wene
  To suche as haue ioy in haunting chiualry.

 "Suche famous ending the name doth magnifie,
  Note worthy duke, no cause is to complayne,
  His life not ended foule nor dishonestly,
  In bed nor tauerne his lustes to maynteyne,
  But like as besemed a noble captayne,
  In sturdie harnes he died for the right,
  From deathes daunger no man may flee certayne,
  But suche death is metest vnto so noble a knight.

 "But death it to call me thinke it vnright,
  Sith his worthy name shall laste perpetuall," [&c.]

This detail and these long quotations have been rendered necessary by the
strange blunder which has been made and perpetuated as to the identity of
the young hero whose death is so feelingly lamented in this elegy. With
that now clearly ascertained, we can not only fix with confidence the date
of the publication of the Eclogues, but by aid of the hint conveyed in the
Prologue, quoted above (p. lv.), as to the author's age, "fortie saue
twayne," decide, for the first time, the duration of his life, and the
dates, approximately at least, of its incidents, and of the appearance of
his undated works. Lord Edward Howard, perhaps the bravest and rashest of
England's admirals, perished in a madly daring attack upon the harbour of
Brest, on the 25th of April, 1514. As the eclogues could not therefore have
been published prior to that date, so, bearing in mind the other allusions
referred to above, they could scarcely have appeared later. Indeed, the
loss which the elegy commemorates is spoken of as quite recent, while the
elegy itself bears every appearance of having been introduced into the
eclogue at the last moment. We feel quite satisfied therefore that Warton
hit quite correctly upon the year 1514 as that in which these poems first
saw the light, though the ground (the allusion to the Henries) upon which
he went was insufficient, and his identification of the hero of the elegy
contradicted his supposition. Had he been aware of the importance of fixing
the date correctly, he would probably have taken more care than to fall
into the blunder of confounding the father with the son, and adorning the
former with the dearly earned laurels of the latter.

It may be added that, fixing 1514 as the date at which Barclay had arrived
at the age of 38, agrees perfectly with all else we know of his years, with
the assumed date of his academical education, and of his travels abroad,
with the suppositions formed as to his age from his various published works
having dates attached to them, and finally, with the traditional "great
age" at which he died, which would thus be six years beyond the allotted
span.

After the Ship of Fools the Eclogues rank second in importance in a
consideration of Barclay's writings. Not only as the first of their kind in
English, do they crown their author with the honour of introducing this
kind of poetry to English literature, but they are in themselves most
interesting and valuable as faithful and graphic pictures of the court,
citizen, and country life of the period. Nowhere else in so accessible a
form do there exist descriptions at once so full and so accurate of the
whole condition of the people. Their daily life and habits, customs,
manners, sports, and pastimes, are all placed on the canvas before us with
a ready, vigorous, unflinching hand. Witness for instance the following
sketch, which might be entitled, "Life, temp. 1514":--

 "Some men deliteth beholding men to fight,
  Or goodly knightes in pleasaunt apparayle,
  Or sturdie souldiers in bright harnes and male.
      .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  Some glad is to see these Ladies beauteous,
  Goodly appoynted in clothing sumpteous:
  A number of people appoynted in like wise:
  In costly clothing after the newest gise,
  Sportes, disgising, fayre coursers mount and praunce,
  Or goodly ladies and knightes sing and daunce:
  To see fayre houses and curious picture(s),
  Or pleasaunt hanging, or sumpteous vesture
  Of silke, of purpure, or golde moste orient,
  And other clothing diuers and excellent:
  Hye curious buildinges or palaces royall,
  Or chapels, temples fayre and substanciall,
  Images grauen or vaultes curious;
  Gardeyns and medowes, or place delicious,
  Forestes and parkes well furnished with dere,
  Colde pleasaunt streames or welles fayre and clere,
  Curious cundites or shadowie mountaynes,
  Swete pleasaunt valleys, laundes or playnes
  Houndes, and suche other thinges manyfolde
  Some men take pleasour and solace to beholde."

The following selections illustrative of the customs and manners of the
times will serve as a sample of the overflowing cask from which they are
taken. The condition of the country people is clearly enough indicated in a
description of the village Sunday, the manner of its celebration being
depicted in language calculated to make a modern sabbatarian's hair stand
on end:--

 "What man is faultlesse, remember the village,
  Howe men vplondish on holy dayes rage.
  Nought can them tame, they be a beastly sort,
  In sweate and labour hauing most chiefe comfort,
  On the holy day assoone as morne is past,
  When all men resteth while all the day doth last,
  They drinke, they banket, they reuell and they iest
  They leape, they daunce, despising ease and rest.
  If they once heare a bagpipe or a drone,
  Anone to the elme or oke they be gone.
  There vse they to daunce, to gambolde and to rage
  Such is the custome and vse of the village.
  When the ground resteth from rake, plough and wheles,
  Then moste they it trouble with burthen of their heles:

                  FAUSTUS.

  To Bacchus they banket, no feast is festiuall,
  They chide and they chat, they vary and they brall,
  They rayle and they route, they reuell and they crye,
  Laughing and leaping, and making cuppes drye.
  What, stint thou thy chat, these wordes I defye,
  It is to a vilayne rebuke and vilany.
  Such rurall solace so plainly for to blame,
  Thy wordes sound to thy rebuke and shame."

Football is described in a lively picture:--

 "They get the bladder and blowe it great and thin,
  With many beanes or peason put within,
  It ratleth, soundeth, and shineth clere and fayre,
  While it is throwen and caste vp in the ayre,
  Eche one contendeth and hath a great delite,
  With foote and with hande the bladder for to smite,
  If it fall to grounde they lifte it vp agayne,
  This wise to labour they count it for no payne,
  Renning and leaping they driue away the colde,
  The sturdie plowmen lustie, stronge and bolde,
  Ouercommeth the winter with driuing the foote ball,
  Forgetting labour and many a greuous fall."

A shepherd, after mentioning his skill in shooting birds with a bow,
says:--

 "No shepheard throweth the axeltrie so farre."

A gallant is thus described:--

 "For women vse to loue them moste of all,
  Which boldly bosteth, or that can sing and iet,
  Which are well decked with large bushes set,
  Which hath the mastery ofte time in tournament,
  Or that can gambauld, or daunce feat and gent."

The following sorts of wine are mentioned:--

 "As Muscadell, Caprike, Romney, and Maluesy,
  From Gene brought, from Grece or Hungary."

As are the dainties of the table. A shepherd at court must not think to
eat,

             "Swanne, nor heron,
  Curlewe, nor crane, but course beefe and mutton."

Again:

 "What fishe is of sauor swete and delicious,--
  Rosted or sodden in swete hearbes or wine;
  Or fried in oyle, most saporous and fine.--
                  The pasties of a hart.--
  The crane, the fesant, the pecocke and curlewe,
  The partriche, plouer, bittor, and heronsewe--
  Seasoned so well in licour redolent,
  That the hall is full of pleasaunt smell and sent."

At a feast at court:--

 "Slowe be the seruers in seruing in alway,
  But swift be they after, taking thy meate away;
  A speciall custome is vsed them among,
  No good dish to suffer on borde to be longe:
  If the dishe be pleasaunt, eyther fleshe or fishe,
  Ten handes at once swarme in the dishe:
  And if it be flesh ten kniues shalt thou see
  Mangling the flesh, and in the platter flee:
  To put there thy handes is perill without fayle,
  Without a gauntlet or els a gloue of mayle."

"The two last lines remind us of a saying of Quin, who declared it was not
safe to sit down to a turtle-feast in one of the city-halls, without a
basket-hilted knife and fork. Not that I suppose Quin borrowed his bon-mots
from black letter books." (Warton.)

The following lines point out some of the festive tales of our ancestors:--

 "Yet would I gladly heare some mery fit
  Of mayde Marion, or els of Robin hood;
  Or Bentleyes ale which chafeth well the bloud,
  Of perre of Norwich, or sauce of Wilberton,
  Or buckishe Joly well-stuffed as a ton."

He again mentions "Bentley's Ale" which "maketh me to winke;" and some of
our ancient domestic pastimes and amusements are recorded:--

 "Then is it pleasure the yonge maydens amonge
  To watche by the fire the winters nightes long:
  At their fonde tales to laugh, or when they brall
  Great fire and candell spending for laboure small,
  And in the ashes some playes for to marke,
  To couer wardens [pears] for fault of other warke:
  To toste white sheuers, and to make prophitroles;
  And after talking oft time to fill the bowles."

He mentions some musical instruments:

 "   .   .   .   .   Methinkes no mirth is scant,
  Where no reioysing of minstrelcie doth want:
  The bagpipe or fidle to vs is delectable."

And the mercantile commodities of different countries and cities:--

 "Englande hath cloth, Burdeus hath store of wine,
  Cornewall hath tinne, and Lymster wools fine.
  London hath scarlet, and Bristowe pleasaunt red,
  Fen lands hath fishes, in other place is lead."

Of songs at feasts:--

 "When your fat dishes smoke hote vpon your table,
  Then layde ye songes and balades magnifie,
  If they be mery, or written craftely,
  Ye clappe your handes and to the making harke,
  And one say to other, lo here a proper warke."

He says that minstrels and singers are highly favoured at court, especially
those of the French gise. Also jugglers and pipers.

The personal references throughout the Eclogues, in addition to those
already mentioned, though not numerous, are of considerable interest. The
learned Alcock, Bishop of Ely (1486-1500), and the munificent founder of
Jesus College, Cambridge, stands deservedly high in the esteem of a poet
and priest, so zealous of good works as Barclay. The poet's humour thus
disguises him.--(Eclogue I., A iii., recto.):--

 "Yes since his dayes a cocke was in the fen,
  I knowe his voyce among a thousande men:
  He taught, he preached, he mended euery wrong;
  But, Coridon alas no good thing bideth long.
  He all was a cocke, he wakened vs from slepe,
  And while we slumbred, he did our foldes hepe.
  No cur, no foxes, nor butchers dogges wood,
  Coulde hurte our fouldes, his watching was so good.
  The hungry wolues, which that time did abounde,
  What time he crowed, abashed at the sounde.
  This cocke was no more abashed of the foxe,
  Than is a lion abashed of an oxe.
  When he went, faded the floure of all the fen;
  I boldly dare sweare this cocke neuer trode hen!
  This was a father of thinges pastorall,
  And that well sheweth his Church cathedrall,
  There was I lately about the middest of May,
  Coridon his Church is twenty sith more gay
  Then all the Churches betwene the same and Kent,
  There sawe I his tome and Chapell excellent.
  I thought fiue houres but euen a little while,
  Saint John the virgin me thought did on me smile,
  Our parishe Church is but a dongeon,
  To that gay Churche in comparison.
  If the people were as pleasaunt as the place
  Then were it paradice of pleasour and solace,
  Then might I truely right well finde in my heart.
  There still to abide and neuer to departe,
  But since that this cocke by death hath left his song,
  Trust me Coridon there many a thing is wrong,
  When I sawe his figure lye in the Chapell-side,
  Like death for weping I might no longer bide.
  Lo all good thinges so sone away doth glide,
  That no man liketh to long doth rest and abide.
  When the good is gone (my mate this is the case)
  Seldome the better reentreth in the place."

The excellence of his subject carries the poet quite beyond himself in
describing the general lamentation at the death of this worthy prelate;
with an unusual power of imagination he thus pictures the sympathy of the
towers, arches, vaults and images of Ely monastery:

 "My harte sore mourneth when I must specify
  Of the gentle cocke whiche sange so mirily,
  He and his flocke wer like an union
  Conioyned in one without discention,
  All the fayre cockes which in his dayes crewe
  When death him touched did his departing rewe.
  The pretie palace by him made in the fen,
  The maides, widowes, the wiues, and the men,
  With deadly dolour were pearsed to the heart,
  When death constrayned this shepheard to departe.
  Corne, grasse, and fieldes, mourned for wo and payne,
  For oft his prayer for them obtayned rayne.
  The pleasaunt floures for wo faded eche one,
  When they perceyued this shepheard dead and gone,
  The okes, elmes, and euery sorte of dere
  Shronke vnder shadowes, abating all their chere.
  The mightie walles of Ely Monastery,
  The stones, rockes, and towres semblably,
  The marble pillers and images echeone,
  Swet all for sorowe, when this good cocke was gone,
  Though he of stature were humble, weake and leane,
  His minde was hye, his liuing pure and cleane,
  Where other feedeth by beastly appetite,
  On heauenly foode was all his whole delite."

Morton, Alcock's predecessor and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury
(1486-1500), is also singled out for compliment, in which allusion is made
to his troubles, his servants' faithfulness, and his restoration to favour
under Richard III. and Henry VII. (Eclogue III.):--

 "And shepheard Morton, when he durst not appeare,
  Howe his olde seruauntes were carefull of his chere;
  In payne and pleasour they kept fidelitie
  Till grace agayne gaue him aucthoritie
  Then his olde fauour did them agayne restore
  To greater pleasour then they had payne before.
  Though for a season this shepheard bode a blast,
  The greatest winde yet slaketh at the last,
  And at conclusion he and his flocke certayne
  Eche true to other did quietly remayne."

And again in Eclogue IV.:--

 "Micene and Morton be dead and gone certayne."

The "Dean of Powles" (Colet), with whom Barclay seems to have been
personally acquainted, and to whom the reference alludes as to one still
living (his death occurred in 1519), is celebrated as a preacher in the
same Eclogue:--

 "For this I learned of the Dean of Powles
  I tell thee, Codrus this man hath won some soules."

as is "the olde friar that wonned in Greenwich" in Eclogue V.

The first three Eclogues are paraphrases or adaptations from the Miseriae
Curialium, the most popular of the works of one of the most successful
literary adventurers of the middle ages, AEneas Sylvius (Pope Pius II., who
died in 1464). It appears to have been written with the view of relieving
his feelings of disappointment and disgust at his reception at the court of
the Emperor, whither he had repaired, in the hope of political advancement.
The tone and nature of the work may be gathered from this candid exposure
of the adventurer's morale: "Many things there are which compel us to
persevere, but nothing more powerfully than ambition which, rivalling
charity, truly beareth all things however grievous, that it may attain to
the honours of this world and the praise of men. If we were humble and
laboured to gain our own souls rather than hunt after vain glory, few of
us, indeed, would endure such annoyances." He details, with querulous
humour, all the grievances of his position, from the ingratitude of the
prince to the sordour of the table-cloths, and the hardness of the black
bread. But hardest of all to bear is the contempt shown towards literature.
"In the courts of princes literary knowledge is held a crime; and great is
the grief of men of letters when they find themselves universally despised,
and see the most important matters managed, not to say mismanaged, by
blockheads, who cannot tell the number of their fingers and toes."

Barclay's adaptation is so thoroughly Englished, and contains such large
additions from the stores of his own bitter experience, as to make it even
more truly his own than any other of his translations.

The fourth and fifth eclogues are imitations,--though no notice that they
are so is conveyed in the title, as in the case of the first three,--of the
fifth and sixth of the popular eclogue writer of the time, Jo. Baptist
Mantuan, which may have helped to give rise to the generally received
statement noticed below, that all the eclogues are imitations of that
author. The fourth is entitled "Codrus and Minalcas, treating of the
behauour of Riche men agaynst Poetes," and it may be judged how far it is
Barclay's from the fact that it numbers about twelve hundred lines,
including the elegy of the Noble Howard, while the original, entitled, "De
consuetudine Divitum erga Poetas," contains only about two hundred. The
fifth is entitled "Amintas and Faustus, of the disputation of citizens and
men of the countrey." It contains over a thousand lines, and the original,
"De disceptatione rusticorum et civium," like the fifth, extends to little
more than two hundred.

In the Prologue before mentioned we are told (Cawood's edition):--

 "That fiue Egloges this whole treatise doth holde
  To imitation of other Poetes olde,"

Which appears to be a correction of the printer's upon the original, as in
Powell's edition:--

 "That X. egloges this hole treatyse dothe holde."

Whether other five were ever published there is no record to show; it
appears, however, highly improbable, that, if they had, they could have
been entirely lost,--especially considering the popularity and repeated
issue of the first five,--during the few years that would have elapsed
between their original publication and the appearance of Cawood's edition.
Possibly the original reading may be a typographical blunder, for Cawood is
extremely sparing of correction, and appears to have made none which he did
not consider absolutely necessary. This is one of the literary puzzles
which remain for bibliography to solve. (See below, p. lxxix.)

The next of Barclay's works in point of date, and perhaps the only one
actually entitled to the merit of originality, is his Introductory to write
and pronounce French, compiled at the request of his great patron, Thomas
Duke of Norfolk, and printed by Copland in 1521. It is thus alluded to in
the first important authority on French grammar, "Lesclarissement de la
langue Francoyse compose par maistre Jehan Palsgraue, Angloys, natyf de
Londres," 1530: "The right vertuous and excellent prince Thomas, late Duke
of Northfolke, hath commanded the studious clerke, Alexandre Barkelay, to
embusy hymselfe about this exercyse." Further on he is not so complimentary
as he remarks:--"Where as there is a boke, that goeth about in this realme,
intitled The introductory to writte and pronounce frenche, compiled by
Alexander Barcley, in which k is moche vsed, and many other thynges also by
hym affirmed, contrary to my sayenges in this boke, and specially in my
seconde, where I shall assaye to expresse the declinations and
coniugatynges with the other congruites obserued in the frenche tonge, I
suppose it sufficient to warne the lernar, that I haue red ouer that boke
at length: and what myn opinion is therin, it shall well inough apere in my
bokes selfe, though I make therof no ferther expresse mencion: saue that I
haue sene an olde boke written in parchement, in maner in all thynkes like
to his sayd Introductory: whiche, by coniecture, was not vnwritten this
hundred yeres. I wot nat if he happened to fortune upon suche an other: for
whan it was commaunded that the grammar maisters shulde teche the youth of
Englande ioyntly latin with frenche, there were diuerse suche bokes
diuysed: wherupon, as I suppose, began one great occasyon why we of England
sounde the latyn tong so corruptly, whiche haue as good a tonge to sounde
all maner speches parfitely as any other nacyon in Europa."--Book I. ch.
xxxv. "According to this," Mr Ellis (Early English Pronunciation, 804)
pertinently notes: "1, there ought to be many old MS. treatises on French
grammar; and 2, the English pronunciation of Latin was moulded on the
French."

To Barclay, as nine years before Palsgrave, belongs at least the credit,
hitherto generally unrecognised, of the first published attempt at a French
grammar, by either Frenchman or foreigner.

"The mirror of good manners, containing the four cardinal vertues,"
appeared from the press of Pynson, without date, "which boke," says the
typographer, "I haue prynted at the instance and request of the ryght noble
Rychard Yerle of Kent." This earl of Kent died in 1523, and as Barclay
speaks of himself in the preface as advanced in age, the date of
publication may be assigned to close upon that year. It is a translation,
in the ballad stanza, of the Latin elegiac poem of Dominicus Mancinus, _De
quatuor virtutibus_, first published in 1516, and, as appears from the
title, was executed while Barclay was a monk of Ely, at "the desire of the
righte worshipfull Syr Giles Alington, Knight." From the address to his
patron it would seem that the Knight had requested the poet to abridge or
modernise Gower's Confessio amantis. For declining this task he pleads,
that he is too old to undertake such a light subject, and also the sacred
nature of his profession. He then intimates his choice of the present more
grave and serious work instead--

  Which a priest may write, not hurting his estate,
  Nor of honest name obumbring at all his light.

"But the poet," says Warton, "declined this undertaking as unsuitable to
his age, infirmities, and profession, and chose rather to oblige his patron
with a grave system of ethics. It is certain that he made a prudent choice.
The performance shows how little qualified he was to correct Gower."
Instead of a carping criticism like this, it would have been much more to
the point to praise the modesty and sensibility of an author, who had the
courage to decline a task unsuited to his tastes or powers.

He professes little:--

  This playne litle treatise in stile compendious,
  Much briefly conteyneth four vertues cardinall,
  In right pleasaunt processe, plaine and commodious,
  With light foote of metre, and stile heroicall,
  Rude people to infourme in language maternall,
  To whose vnderstanding maydens of tender age,
  And rude litle children shall finde easy passage.

Two editions of the work are sufficient evidence that this humble and
praiseworthy purpose was, in the eyes of his contemporaries, successfully
carried out.

The only remaining authentic production of Barclay which has come down to
us, is a translation of the Jugurthine War of Sallust, undertaken at the
request of, and dedicated to, his great patron, Thomas Duke of Norfolk, and
printed also at Pynson's press without date. The Latin and English are
printed side by side on the same page, the former being dedicated, with the
date "Ex cellula Hatfelde[=n] regii (_i.e._, King's Hatfield,
Hertfordshire) in Idus Novembris" to Vesey, the centenarian Bishop of
Exeter, with this superscription:--"Reueredissimo in Christo patri ac dno:
dno Joanni Veysy exonien episcopo Alexander Barclay presbyter debita cum
obseruantia. S." The dedication begins, "Memini me superioribus annis cu
adhuc sacelli regij presul esses: pastor vigilantissime: tuis suasionibus
incitatu: vt Crispi Salustij hystoria--e romana lingua: in anglicam
compendiose transferrem," &c. Vesey was probably one of Barclay's oldest
west country friends; for he is recorded to have been connected with the
diocese of Exeter from 1503 to 1551, in the various capacities of
archdeacon, precentor, dean, and bishop successively. Conjecture has placed
the date of this publication at 1511, but as Veysey did not succeed to the
Bishopric of Exeter till August 1519, this is untenable. We cannot say more
than that it must have been published between 1519 and 1524, the date of
the Duke of Norfolk's death, probably in the former year, since, from its
being dated from "Hatfield," the ancient palace of the bishops of Ely,
(sold to the Crown in the 30th of Henry VIII.; Clutterbuck's Hertfordshire,
II.) Barclay at the time of its completion was evidently still a monk of
Ely.

By his translation of Sallust (so popular an author at that period, that
the learned virgin queen is reported to have amused her leisure with an
English version), Barclay obtained the distinction of being the first to
introduce that classic to English readers. His version bears the reputation
of being executed not only with accuracy, but with considerable freedom and
elegance, and its popularity was evinced by its appearance in three
additions.

Two other works of our author are spoken of as having been in print, but
they have apparently passed entirely out of sight: "The figure of our holy
mother Church, oppressed by the Frenche King," (Pynson, 4to), known only
from Maunsell's Catalogue; and "The lyfe of the glorious martyr, saynt
George translated (from Mantuan) by Alexander Barclay, while he was a monk
of Ely, and dedicated to N. West, Bishop of Ely," (Pynson, 4to), (Herbert,
Typ. Antiquities.) West was Bishop of Ely from 1515 to 1533, and
consequently Barclay's superior during probably his whole stay there.
Whether these two works were in verse or prose is unknown.

There are two other books ascribed to Barclay, but nothing satisfactory can
be stated regarding their parentage except that, considering their subject,
and the press they issued from, it is not at all unlikely that they may
have been the fruit of his prolific pen. The first is "The lyfe of the
blessed martyr, Saynte Thomas," in prose, printed by Pynson, (Herbert, Typ.
Ant. 292), regarding which Ant. Wood says, "I should feel little difficulty
in ascribing this to Barclay." The other is the English translation of the
Histoire merveilleuse du Grand Khan (in Latin, De Tartaris siue Liber
historiarum partium Orientis) of the eastern soldier, and western monk,
Haytho, prince of Georgia at the end of the 13th, and beginning of the 14th
centuries. The History which gives an account of Genghis Khan, and his
successors, with a short description of the different kingdoms of Asia, was
very popular in the 15th and 16th centuries, as one of the earliest
accounts of the East, and the conjecture of the Grenville Catalogue is not
improbable, though there is no sufficient evidence, that Barclay was the
author of the English version which appeared from the press of Pynson.

Bale further enumerates in his list of Barclay's works "Contra Skeltonum,
Lib. I.; Quinq: eglogas ex Mantuano, Lib. I; Vitam D. Catherinae, Lib. I.,
[Libros tres, Pits]; Vitam D. Margaritae, Lib. I.; Vitam Etheldredae, Lib.
I.; Aliaq: plura fecit." Tanner adds: "Orationes varias, Lib. I.; De fide
orthodoxa, Lib. I."

Of these various fruits of Barclay's fertility and industry no fragment has
survived to our day, nor has even any positive information regarding their
nature been transmitted to us.

The "Orationes varias," probably a collection of sermons with especial
reference to the sins of the day would have been historically, if not
otherwise, interesting, and their loss is matter for regret. On the other
hand the want of the treatise, "De fide orthodoxa," is doubtless a relief
to literature. There are too many of the kind already to encumber our
shelves and our catalogues.

The Lives of the Saints, the work, it is stated, of the author's old age,
were, according to Tanner, and he is no doubt right, translations from the
Latin. Barclay's reputation probably does not suffer from their loss.

"Quinque eglogas ex Mantuano," though Bale mentions also "De miserijs
aulicorum; Bucolicam Codri; Eglogam quartam," apparently the five, but
really the first four of the eclogues known to us, are, I am strongly
inclined to believe, nothing else than these same five eclogues, under, to
use a bibliographical phrase, "a made up" title. That he mentions first,
five from Mantuan, and afterwards adds "Bucolicam Codri" and "Eglogam
quartam," as two distinct eclogues, apparently not from Mantuan, while both
titles must refer to the same poem, an imitation of Mantuan's fifth
eclogue, is proof enough that he was not speaking with the authority of
personal knowledge of these works.

Johannes Baptista Spagnuoli, commonly called from his native city, Mantuan,
was the most popular and prolific eclogue writer of the fifteenth century,
to which Barclay himself testifies:--

 "As the moste famous Baptist Mantuan
  The best of that sort since Poetes first began."

Barclay's Eclogues being the first attempts of the kind in English, Bale's
"Ex Mantuano," therefore probably means nothing more than "on the model of
Mantuan;" otherwise, if it be assumed that five were the whole number that
ever appeared, it could not apply to the first three, which are expressly
stated in the title to be from AEneas Sylvius, while if ten be assumed, his
statement would account for nine, the "quinque eglogas" being the five now
wanting, but if so, then he has omitted to mention the most popular of all
the eclogues, the fifth, and has failed to attribute to Mantuan two which
are undoubtedly due to him.

The loss of the "Contra Skeltonum," is a matter for regret. That there was
no love lost between these two contemporaries and chief poets of their time
is evident enough. Skelton's scathing sarcasm against the priesthood no
doubt woke his brother satirist's ire, and the latter lets no opportunity
slip of launching forth his contempt for the laureate of Oxford.

The moralist in announcing the position he assumes in opposition to the
writer of popular tales, takes care to have a fling at the author of "The
boke of Phyllyp Sparowe":--

 "I wryte no Ieste ne tale of Robyn Hode,
  Nor sawe no sparcles, ne sede of vyciousnes;
  Wyse men loue vertue, wylde people wantones,
  It longeth nat to my scyence nor cunnynge,
  For Phylyp the sparowe the (Dirige) to synge."

A sneer to which Skelton most probably alludes when, enumerating his own
productions in the Garlande of Laurell, he mentions,

 "Of Phillip Sparow the lamentable fate,
  The dolefull desteny, and the carefull chaunce,
  Dyuysed by Skelton after the funerall rate;
  Yet sum there be therewith that take greuaunce,
  And grudge thereat with frownyng countenaunce;
  But what of that? harde it is to please all men;
  Who list amende it, let hym set to his penne."

The following onslaught in Barclay's Fourth Eclogue, is evidently levelled
at the abominable Skelton:

 "Another thing yet is greatly more damnable:
  Of rascolde poetes yet is a shamfull rable,
  Which voyde of wisedome presumeth to indite,
  Though they haue scantly the cunning of a snite;
  And to what vices that princes moste intende,
  Those dare these fooles solemnize and commende
  Then is he decked as Poete laureate,
  When stinking Thais made him her graduate;
  When Muses rested, she did her season note,
  And she with Bacchus her camous did promote.
  Such rascolde drames, promoted by Thais,
  Bacchus, Licoris, or yet by Testalis,
  Or by suche other newe forged Muses nine,
  Thinke in their mindes for to haue wit diuine;
  They laude their verses, they boast, they vaunt and iet,
  Though all their cunning be scantly worth a pet:
  If they haue smelled the artes triuiall,
  They count them Poetes hye and heroicall.
  Such is their foly, so foolishly they dote,
  Thinking that none can their playne errour note;
  Yet be they foolishe, auoyde of honestie,
  Nothing seasoned with spice of grauitie,
  Auoyde of pleasure, auoyde of eloquence,
  With many wordes, and fruitlesse of sentence;
  Unapt to learne, disdayning to be taught,
  Their priuate pleasure in snare hath them so caught;
  And worst yet of all, they count them excellent,
  Though they be fruitlesse, rashe and improuident.
  To such ambages who doth their minde incline,
  They count all other as priuate of doctrine,
  And that the faultes which be in them alone,
  And be common in other men eche one.
  Thus bide good poetes oft time rebuke and blame,
  Because of other which haue despised name.
  And thus for the bad the good be cleane abject.
  Their art and poeme counted of none effect,
  Who wanteth reason good to discerne from ill
  Doth worthy writers interprete at his will:
  So both the laudes of good and not laudable
  For lacke of knowledge become vituperable."

It has not hitherto been pointed out that Skelton did not disdain to borrow
a leaf from the enemy's book and try his hand at paraphrasing the Ship of
Fools also. "The Boke of three fooles, M. Skelton, poete laureate, gaue to
my lord Cardynall," is a paraphrase in prose, with introductory verses, of
three chapters of Brandt, corresponding to Barclay's chapters headed, Of
yonge folys that take olde wyme to theyr wyues nat for loue but for ryches
(I. 247); Of enuyous folys (I. 252); Of bodely lust or corporall
voluptuosyte (I. 239). Skelton's three fools, are, "The man that doth wed a
wyfe for her goodes and her rychesse;" "Of Enuye, the seconde foole"; and,
"Of the Voluptuousnes corporall, the third foole;" and his versions are
dashed off with his usual racy vigour. He probably, however, did not think
it worth while to compete with the established favourite. If he had we
would certainly have got a very different book from Barclay's.

Notwithstanding his popularity and industry, Barclay's name appears to be
but seldom mentioned by contemporary or later authors. As early as 1521
however, we find him placed in the most honourable company by Henry
Bradshaw, "Lyfe of Saynt Werburghe," (1521, Pynson, 4to). But the
compliment would probably lose half its sweetness from his being bracketed
with the detested Skelton:--

  To all auncient poetes, litell boke, submytte the,
  Whilom flouryng in eloquence facundious,
  And to all other whiche present nowe be;
  Fyrst to maister Chaucer and Ludgate sentencious,
  Also to preignaunt Barkley nowe beying religious,
  To inuentiue Skelton and poet laureate;
  Praye them all of pardon both erly and late.

Bulleyn's repeated allusions to Barclay (see above, pp. xxvii., liv.),
apart from the probability that, as contemporaries resident in the same
provincial town, Ely, they were well acquainted with each other, leave
little doubt that the two were personal friends. Bulleyn's figurative
description of the poet, quoted at p. xxvii., is scarcely complete without
the following verses, which are appended to it by way of summary of his
teachings (similar verses are appended to the descriptions of Chaucer,
Gower, &c.):--[Barclay appears] saying

 "Who entreth the court in yong and teder age
  Are lightly blinded with foly and outrage:
  But suche as enter with witte and grauitie,
  Bow not so sone to such enormitie,
  But ere thei enter if thei haue lerned nought
  Afterwardes Vertue the least of theyr thought."
                      _Dialogue against the Fever Pestilence._

In another passage of the same Dialogue[4] the picture of the honourable
and deserving but neglected churchman is touched with so much strength and
feeling that, though no indication is given, one cannot but believe that
the painter was drawing from the life, the life of his friend. The
likeness, whether intentional or not, is a most faithful one: "The third
[picture] is, one whiche sheweth the state of learned men, labouring long
time in studie and diuine vertue, whiche are wrapped in pouertie, wantyng
the golden rake or gapyng mouth. This man hath verie fewe to preferre hym
to that promotion, he smiteth himselfe upo the breast, he wepeth and
lamenteth, that vice should thus be exalted, ignoraunce rewarded with
glorie, coueteous men spoilyng the Churche, by the names of patrones and
geuers, whiche extorcioners and tellers, they care not to whom, so that it
be raked with the golden racke. Wel, wel, God of his mercie, amed this
euill market."

In one of the many humorous sallies which lighten up this old-fashioned
antidote to the pestilence, Barclay again appears, dressed in the
metaphorical colour of the poet or minstrel--green, which has probably here
a double significance, referring no doubt to his popularity as the English
eclogue writer as well as to his fame as a poet and satirist. In
introducing "Bartlet, grene breche" as the antithesis to "Boner wepyng,"
allusion was also probably intended to the honourable position occupied by
Barclay amongst the promoters of the Reformation, compared with the
reapostacy, the career of brutal cruelty, and the deserved fate of the
Jefferies of the Episcopal bench.

Thus discourse _Civis et Uxor_.--

"_Uxor._ What are all these two and two in a table. Oh it is trim. _Civis._
These are old frendes, it is well handled and workemanly. Willyam Boswell
in Pater noster rowe, painted them. Here is Christ, and Sathan, Sainct
Peter, and Symon Magus, Paule, and Alexader the Coppersmith, Trace, and
Becket, Martin Luther, and the Pope ... bishop Cramer, and bishop Gardiner.
Boner wepyng, Bartlet, grene breche ... Salomon, and Will Sommer. The cocke
and the lyon, the wolfe and the lambe." This passage also necessarily
implies that Barclay's fame at that time was second to none in England.
Alas! for fame:

 "What is the end of fame? 'Tis but to fill
  A certain portion of uncertain paper."

In the seventeenth century Barclay still held a place in the first rank of
satirists, if we accept the evidence of the learned Catholic poet of that
time, Sir Aston Cokaine. He thus alludes to him in an address "To my
learned friend, Mr Thomas Bancroft, upon his Book of Satires. By Sir Aston
Cokayne."

 "After a many works of divers kinds
  Your muse to tread th' Aruncan path designs:
 'Tis hard to write but Satires in these days,
  And yet to write good Satires merits praise:
      .    .    .    .    .    .
  So old Petronius Arbiter appli'd
  Corsives unto the age he did deride:
  So Horace, Persius, Juvenal, (among
  Those ancient Romans) scourg'd the impious throng;
  So Ariosto (in these later times)
  Reprov'd his Italy for many crimes;
  So learned Barclay let his lashes fall
  Heavy on some to bring a cure to all."

In concluding this imperfect notice of one of the most remarkable of our
early writers, we cannot but echo the regret expressed by one of his
biographers, that "What ought most to be lamented is, that we are able to
say so very little of one in his own time so famous, and whose works ought
to have transmitted him to posterity with much greater honour."

NOTES.

       *       *       *       *       *

[1] BARCLAY'S NATIONALITY

The objection raised to claiming Barclay as a Scotsman, founded on the
ground that he nowhere mentions his nationality, though it was a common
practice of authors in his time to do so, especially when they wrote out of
their own country, appeared to me, though ingenious and pertinent, to be of
so little real weight, as to be dismissed in a parenthesis. Its importance,
however, may easily be overrated, and it may therefore be well to point out
that, apart from the possibility that this omission on his part was the
result of accident or indifference, there is also the probability that it
was dictated by a wise discretion. To be a Scotsman was not in the days of
Henry VIII., as it has been in later and more auspicious times, a passport
to confidence and popularity, either at the court or among the people of
England. Barclay's fate having led him, and probably his nearest relatives
also, across that Border which no Scotsman ever recrosses, to live and
labour among a people by no means friendly to his country, it would have
been a folly which so sensible a man as he was not likely to commit to have
displayed the red rag of his nationality before his easily excited
neighbours, upon whose friendliness his comfort and success depended. The
farther argument of the Biographia Brittannica, that "it is pretty
extraordinary that Barclay himself, in his several addresses to his
patrons, should never take notice of his being a stranger, which would have
made their kindness to him the more remarkable," is sufficiently disposed
of by the succeeding statement, that the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of
Kent, Barclay's principal patrons, "are known to have been the fiercest
enemies of the Scots." Surely a man who was English in everything but his
birth could not be expected to openly blazon his Scottish nativity, without
adequate occasion for so doing, in the very face of his country's chiefest
enemies, who were at the same time his own best friends. His caution in
this respect, indeed, may be regarded as an additional proof of his
Scottish origin.

[2] BARCLAY'S VOCABULARY

Some of the words, stated in popular fashion to be Scotch--they are of
course of Saxon origin--the usage of which by Barclay is adduced as an
evidence of his nationality, are also to be found in Chaucer, but that does
not invalidate the argument as stated. The employment of so many words of
northern usage must form at least a strong corroborative argument in favour
of northern origin.

[3] THE CASTLE OF LABOUR

It ought to be stated that the modesty of the young author prevented him
from affixing his name to his first production, The Castle of Labour. Both
editions are anonymous. Bale, Pits, Wood, &c., all include it in the list
of his works without remark.

[4] BULLEYN'S DIALOGUE

A notice of the history of this once popular Dialogue, its ever recurring
disappearance, and ever recurring "discovery" by some fortunate antiquary,
would form an interesting chapter in a new "History of the transmission of
ancient books to modern times." Its chances of preservation and record were
unusually favourable. It must have been disseminated over the length and
breadth of the land in its day, having run through four editions in little
more than a dozen years. Maunsell's Catalogue (1595) records the edition of
1578. Antony Wood (1721), and Bishop Tanner (1748) both duly give it a
place in their notices of the productions of its author, without any
special remark. But the Biographia Brittanica (1748) in a long article upon
Bulleyn, in which his various works are noticed in great detail, introduces
the Dialogue as "_this long neglected and unknown treatise_," and gives an
elaborate account of it extending to about five columns of small print. The
now famous passage, descriptive of the early poets, is quoted at length,
and special notice of its bearing on Barclay's nationality taken, the
writer (Oldys) announcing that the dispute must now be settled in favour of
Scotland, "Seeing our author (Bulleyn), a contemporary who lived in, and
long upon the borders of Scotland, says, as above, he was born in that
kingdom: and as much indeed might have been in great measure gathered from
an attentive perusal of this poet himself."

The next biographer of Bulleyn, Aikin (Biog. Memoirs of Medicine, 1780),
makes no discovery, but contents himself with giving a brief account of the
Dialogue (in 11/2 pages), in which the description of Chaucer, &c., is duly
noticed. Three years later, in spite of this, and the appearance of a
second edition of the Biographia Brittanica (1778), another really learned
and able antiquary, Waldron, in his edition of Jonson's Sad Shepherd
(1783), comes forth triumphantly announcing his discovery of the Dialogue
as that of a hitherto totally unknown treasure; and in an appendix favours
the curious with a series of extracts from it, extending to more than
thirty pages, prefacing them thus: "Having, among the various Mysteries and
Moralities, whether original impressions, reprinted, or described only by
those writers who have given any account of these Embrios of the English
Drama, _never met with or read of any other copy of the Dialogue, or
Morality, by Bulleyn, than the one_, [which I have used], an account of and
some extracts from it may not be unpleasing." The passage regarding the
poets is of course given _ad longum_.

The next notice of the Dialogue occurs in Herbert's Ames (1786), where two
editions, 1564 and 1578, are entered. Dibdin (1819), in addition, notices
the edition of 1573. In the biographical accounts of Bulleyn in
Hutchinson's Biographia Medica (1799), Aikin's General Biog. Dict. (1801),
and its successor, Chalmers's Biog. Dict. (1812), due mention is preserved
of the Dialogue in enumerating the works of its author. Sir Walter Scott
alludes to it in the Introduction to the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border
(1802) as a "mystery," but his only knowledge of it is evidently derived
from Waldron. Chalmers's Life of Lindsay (Poetical Works, 1806) has also
kept it prominently before a considerable class of inquirers, as he gives
that part of the description of the poets relating to Lindsay a conspicuous
place, with the following note: "Owing to the very obliging temper of Mr
Waldron I have been permitted to see that _rare book_ of Dr Bulleyn, with
the second edition of 1569, which is remarkably different from the first in
1564." To this use of it by Chalmers we owe the references to it in Lord
Lindsay's Lives of the Lindsays, i. 261 (1849), Seton's Scottish Heraldry,
480 (1863), and Notes and Queries, 3rd s., iv. 164 (1863). It was also
probably Chalmers that drew the attention of the writer of the Memoir of
Barclay in the Lives of the Scottish Poets (1822), to the possibility of
there being also in the Dialogue notice of that poet. At any rate, he
quotes the description of the early poets, showing in his preliminary
remarks considerable familiarity with Bulleyn's history, pointing out the
probability of his having known Barclay at Ely, and arguing that whether or
not, "from living in the same neighbourhood he had an opportunity of
knowing better than any contemporary whose evidence on the subject is
extant, to what country Barclay was, by all about him, reputed to belong."
He precedes his quotations thus: "As the whole passage possesses
considerable elegance, and has been so _universally overlooked_ by the
critics, the transcription of it here will not probably be deemed out of
place." No mention is made of the title of the book from which the
"Allegorical Description of the Early English Poets" is taken; hence it is
impossible to say whether the quoter made use of a copy of the Dialogue, or
of Waldron's Notes. The spelling is modernised.

In various well-known bibliographical publications the existence of this
fugitive Dialogue is carefully registered, and its title, at least, made
known to all inquirers,--in Watt's Bibliotheca Britt. (1824), in Lowndes'
Bibliog. Manual (1834), and in Atkinson's Medical Bibliog. (1834); and by
the published Catalogues of the British Museum (1813), the Douce Collection
(1840), and the Bodleian Library (1843), it is made known that there are
copies of it preserved in these great collections. In Warton's Hist. of
Eng. Poetry (ed. 1840), it is also recorded by Park, in his notes to the
chapter on Gower, in which he refers to Bulleyn's visionary description of
that poet. Cooper's Athenae Cantabrigienses, art. Bulleyn (1858), also
carefully notes the Dialogue and its editions. And in 1865 Collier's
well-known Bibliographical Account of Early English Literature again gives
an account (two pages long) of the much neglected production, in which the
passage relating to the poets is once more extracted in full, with the
preliminary remarks as quoted at p. xxvii. _supra_, but without the usual
announcement that the work has hitherto been unknown.

But in 1873, by the very last man from whom we might have expected it (F.
J. Furnivall, the Atlas on whose shoulders all our projects for the
preservation of our early literature rest, in Notes and Queries, 4th s.,
xii. 161), we are again introduced to this ever disappearing, ever
reappearing Dialogue as a fresh find in early English literature: "Few
things are pleasanter in reading old books than to come on a passage of
praise of our old poets, showing that in Tudor days men cared for the
'makers' of former days as we do still. To Mr David Laing's kindness I owe
the introduction to the following quotation from a rare tract, where one
wouldn't have expected to find such a passage," and then follows once more
the whole passage so often quoted for the first time. Dr Rimbault, in an
interesting note in a succeeding number of Notes and Queries (p. 234), is
the first one acquainted with the Dialogue to state that "this amusing old
work is perfectly well known, and has often been quoted from." So
henceforth we may presume that this interesting and long-fertile field of
discovery may be regarded as finally worked out.

I. THE CASTELL OF LABOURE.--Wynkyn de Worde. 1506. Small Quarto. Black
letter.

    The title, "The castell of laboure," is within a scroll above a woodcut
    of men over a tub: on the verso, a cut of a man sitting at a desk. At
    sign. a ii. (recto) "Here begynneth the prologue of this present
    treatyse." [The Brit. Mus. copy has this on the verso of the title
    instead of the cut, a peculiarity which may entitle it to be called a
    separate edition, though it appears to agree otherwise with the copy
    described.] There are many curious woodcuts. Colophon on the reverse of
    sign. i iii. (51^b): "Thus endeth the castell of labour, wherin is
    rychesse, vertue, and honour. Enprynted at London in Fletestrete in the
    sygne of the sonne. by Wynkyn de worde. Anno d[=n]i M.ccccc.vi." There
    is no indication of authorship. Signatures: a b c d e f g h,
    alternately 8s and 4s, i 4; 52 leaves, not numbered. The British Museum
    and Cambridge University Library copies of this book have been
    collated, but as the former ends with H 3 and the latter wants the last
    leaf, that leaf must remain undescribed. Mr Bradshaw, however, says,
    "it almost certainly contained a woodcut on the recto, and one of the
    devices on the verso."

    A copy of this very scarce book was sold among Mr. West's books in 1773
    for L2.

I.a. THE CASTELL OF LABOURE.--Pynson. No date. Small Quarto. Black letter.

    The title, "Here begynneth the castell of laboure," is over a woodcut;
    and on the reverse is a woodcut; both the same as those in the previous
    edition. In the body of the work there are 30 woodcuts, which differ
    from those of the first edition, one of these (at G 6) is a repetition
    of that on the title page. Colophon: "Thus endeth the castell of labour
    wherin is rychesse, vertue and honoure. Enprynted be me Richarde
    Pynson." After the colophon comes another leaf (I 6), on the recto of
    which is the printer's device, and on the verso a woodcut representing
    a city on the banks of a river. Without indication of authorship.
    Signatures: A, 8 leaves; B--I, in sixes.

    "Neither Ames nor Herbert appear to have seen this rare volume; which
    is probably a reprint of Wynkyn de Worde's impression of 1506."
    (Dibdin's Typ. Antiq., II. 557.) There is a copy in the Library of H.
    Huth, Esq.

       *       *       *       *       *

II. THE SHIP OF FOLYS OF THE WORLDE.--Pynson. 1509. Folio.

    On the recto of the first leaf there is a large woodcut of Pynson's
    arms, or device No. VII., similar to that which is on the reverse of
    the last leaf of each of the volumes of his edition of Lord Berners'
    translation of Froissart's Chronicles; on the back of the first leaf is
    the translator's dedication to "Thomas Cornisshe, bishop of Tine, and
    suffragan bishop of Bath;" on the next leaf begins "The regyster or
    table of this present boke in Englyshe," (all as on pp. cxiii.--cxx.),
    succeeded by a Latin table. Then on sign. a i. and fol. i. a large
    woodcut, the same as is used for the title page of Cawood's edition
    (and on p. 313, Vol. II.), with a Latin description in the margin.
    Beneath is the title in Latin. On the back, "Alexander Barclay
    excusynge the rudeness of his translacion," followed with "An
    exhortacion of Alexander Barclay." Then on fol. ii., etc., follow in
    Latin, "Epigramma," "Epistola" in prose, and various "Carmina." On the
    back of fol. v. "The exhortacion of Brant to the fools" in Latin verse,
    followed by Barclay's version with the heading "Barclay the Translatour
    tho the Foles." On fol. iiii. the "Prologus Jacobi Locher ... incipit,"
    followed by its translation into English. On fol. ix., etc.,
    "Hecatastichon in proludium auctoris et Libelli Narragonici" and the
    English translation, "Here begynneth the prologe." On xii. "The
    Argument" in Latin and English, and then on xiii. commences the first
    chapter, "De inutilibus libris," in Latin, and then in English, which
    is the order throughout, with the cuts at the beginning of either the
    one or other as the page suited. The book concludes with a ballad in
    honour of the virgin Mary, consisting of twelve octave stanzas: at the
    end of which is the colophon in a stanza of seven lines. On the verso
    of the last leaf is the printer's device, No. v.

    The Latin is uniformly printed in the Roman type, and the English in
    the Gothic. Herbert supposes the diphthongs to be "the first perhaps
    used in this kingdom."

    The cuts are rude, coarse, English imitations of those in the original
    editions. They are, including the preliminary one, 118 in number. The
    cut illustrating the chapter, "Of them that correct other," etc., fol.
    liii. has been exchanged with the cut of the succeeding chapter. The
    cut illustrating "The unyuersall shyp and generall Barke," fol.
    cclxii., is repeated at the succeeding chapter. The one illustrating
    Barclay's new chapter "Of folys that ar ouer worldly" is an imitation
    of the illustration of "De singularitate quorundam novorum fatuorum" in
    the Latin edition of March 1497. The cut illustrating the ballad of the
    Virgin appears in the original at the head of "Excusatio Jacobi Locher
    Philomusi," and illustrates, according to the margin, "Derisio boni
    operis."

    The word "Folium" is on the left hand page, and the number, in Roman
    capitals, on the right throughout the book; the last is cclxxiiii.
    Including the dedication and table (4 folios) there are 283 folios. The
    numbering is a model of irregularity: iiii. is repeated for vi., xx.
    stands for xv., xviii. is repeated, xx. is wanting, xxii. is repeated,
    xxiv. is wanting, xxx. is repeated, xxxvi. is wanting, xxxix. is
    repeated in place of xliv., xlviii. is wanting, xlix. is repeated, lvii
    is repeated after lxi., lviii follows twice, lix., lx., lxi. being
    repeated in succession after lviii., lxvii., lxviii. are repeated after
    lxviii., lxxxii. is wanting, lxxxiii. is repeated, lxxxii. stands for
    lxxxvii., lxxxiii. succeeds for lxxxviiii, cclxv. succeeds for lxxxix.,
    lxxxxii. is repeated for lxxxxvii., [in the Grenville copy this leaf is
    correctly numbered], cxxxii is wanting, cxl. stands for cxxxviii.,
    cxlxi. stands for cxlvi., clxxiv. is wanting, clxxxxxi. stands for
    cci., ccxii. is repeated for ccxvii., ccxxxviii. is wanting, cclx.
    stands for ccl., cclviii. is repeated for cclx.

    The numeration by signatures is as follows: + iiij; a, 8; b--p, 6 s; q,
    7; r, s, t, v, x, y, z, &, 6 s; A--Y, 6 s.

    The book is extremely rare. There is a fine copy in the Bodleian
    Library among Selden's books, another in the British Museum, Grenville
    Collection, and another in the Library of St. John's College, Oxford.

    The following are the more notable prices: Farmer, 1798, L2. 4s.;
    Sotheby's, 1821, L28; Dent, L30. 9s.; Bib. Anglo-Poetica, L105;
    Perkins, 1873, L130.

    The following amusing note on prices is taken from Renouard's
    "Catalogue d'un Amateur." "Les premieres editions latines de ce
    singulier livre, celles des traductions francoises, toutes egalement
    remplies de figures en bois, ne deplaisent pas aux amateurs, mais
    jamais ils ne les ont payees un haut prix. La traduction angloise faite
    en 1509, sur le francois, et avec des figures en bois, plus mauvaises
    encore que leurs modeles, se paye en Angleterre 25, 30 et meme 60
    guinees; c'est la, si l'on veut, du zele patriotique, de l'esprit
    national."

II.a. STULTIFERA NAUIS.... THE SHIP OF FOOLES..... With diuers other
workes.... very profitable and fruitfull for all men.... Cawood. 1570.
Folio.

    A large cut of vessels filled with fools (the same as on p. 313, Vol.
    II.) is inserted between the Latin and English titles. This edition
    omits the ballad to the Virgin at the end. The English is in black
    letter, and the Latin in Roman, in the same order as in the preceding
    edition. On the recto of leaf 259: Thus endeth the Ship of Fooles,
    translated ... by Alexander Barclay Priest, at that time Chaplen in the
    Colledge of S. Mary Otery in the Countie of Deuon. Anno Domini 1508. On
    the back "Excusatio Iacobi Locher Philomusi," in Sapphic verse. On the
    next page five stanzas by Barclay "excusing the rudenes of his
    Translation." Lastly, an Index in Latin, and then in English. Then,
    follow the "diuers other workes," the Mirrour of good maners, and the
    Egloges. Colophon: Imprinted at London in Paules Church-yarde by Iohn
    Cawood Printer to the Queenes Maiestie. Cum Priuilegio ad imprimendum
    solum.

    The woodcuts, including the one on the title-page, number 117. They are
    the same as those of Pynson's edition, but show occasional traces of
    the blocks having been chipped in the course of their preservation in a
    printer's office for 60 years or so. The borders only differ, being of
    a uniform type, while those of the previous edition are woodcuts of
    several patterns.

    The numbering is a little irregular; the preliminary leaves (12) are
    unnumbered. The folios are numbered in figures on the left hand page,
    'folio' being prefixed to the first six, 16 is repeated for 17, 13
    stands for 31, [in one of the Adv. Lib. copies the latter irregularity
    is found, though not the former; in the other, 17 and 31 are numbered
    correctly], 96 is repeated for 99, 188 for 191, 100 for 200, and 205
    for 201. The last number is 259, and there are three extra leaves, thus
    making 274 for the Ship. The supplementary works are not numbered. The
    signatures are as follows: _The Ship_,  six leaves;  six leaves; A
    to U u, in sixes; X x, four leaves; _Mirrour of good manners_, A--G, in
    sixes; _Egloges_, A to D, in sixes; in all 680 pp.

    This book was licensed to Cawood in 1567-8, and is said to be the only
    book he had license for. It is now very rare.

    A complete bibliography of the various editions and versions of the
    Ship of Fools will be found in Zarocke's edition of the original, or in
    Graesse's Tresor de livres rares et precieux. A notice is subjoined of
    the two editions of the English prose translation, and of the two other
    publications bearing the title.

    The abridged prose translation, by Henry Watson, from the French prose
    version of Jehan Droyn, appeared from the press of De Worde in the same
    year in which Barclay's fuller poetical version was issued. In both
    text and illustrations it is a much inferior production to the latter.
    As the existence of the first edition has been, and still is, denied,
    it being frequently confounded with Barclay's book, we transcribe the
    following description of the only known copy from Van Praet's
    "Catalogue des livres imprimes sur velin de la Bibliotheque du Roi."

III. THE EGLOGES OF ALEXADER BARCLAY, PREST.--The first three, without
printer's name or device. No date. Quarto. Black letter.

    "Here begynneth the Egloges of Alexader Barclay, prest, wherof the
    fyrst thre conteyneth the myseryes of courters and courtes of all

    Miserie Curialiu, compyled by Eneas Siluius, Poete and oratour, whiche
    after was Pope of Rome, & named Pius." This title is over a cut of two
    shepherds, Coridon and Cornix, the interlocutors in these three
    eclogues. On the back is a cut of David and Bathsheba. At the end of
    the third egloge: "Thus endyth the thyrde and last egloge of the mysery
    of court and courters, composed by Alexander Barclay, preste, in his
    youthe." A cut of the two shepherds and a courtier fills up the page.
    Without date, printer's name, or device. Contains P 6, in fours, the
    last leaf blank.

    Hawarde contended to entre, by worthy acts of chiualry," related by
    Menalcas, in stanzas of eight verses. At the end, "Thus endeth the
    fourthe Eglogge of Alexandre Barcley, coteyning the maner of the riche

    This title is over a large woodcut of a priest, sitting in his study.
    Beneath, "Here after foloweth the Prologe." On the verso of A ii. are
    two cuts of two shepherds, whole lengths, with this head-title,
    "Interlocutoures be Amyntas and Faustus." There are no other cuts.
    Colophon: "Here endeth the v. Eglog of Alexandre Barclay of the Cytezyn
    and vplondysshman. Imprynted at London in flete strete, at the sygne of
    [the] Sonne, by Wynkyn de worde." Beneath, device No. v. Contains A 8,

IV. THE INTRODUCTORY TO WRITE AND TO PRONOUNCE FRENCHE. Coplande. 1521.
Folio. Black letter.

    'Here begynneth the introductory to wryte, and to pronounce Frenche
    compyled by Alexander Barcley compendiously at the commaudemet of the
    ryght hye excellent and myghty prynce Thomas duke of Northfolke.' This
    title is over a large woodcut of a lion rampant, supporting a shield,
    containing a white lion in a border, (the same as that on the title of
    the Sallust, VI.), then follows a French ballad of 16 lines in two
    columns, the first headed, "R. Coplande to the whyte lyone, and the
    second, " Ballade." On the recto of the last leaf, 'Here foloweth the
    maner of dauncynge of bace dauces after the vse of fraunce & other
    places translated out of frenche in englysshe by Robert coplande.'

    In the edition of Palsgrave (see above, p. lxxiii.), published among
    the "Documents inedits sur l'histoire de France," the editor says of
    this work of Barclay's: "Tous mes efforts pour decouvrir un exemplaire
    de ce curieux ouvrage ont ete inutiles." There is a copy, probably
    unique, in the Bodleian; it was formerly Herbert's, afterwards Douce's.

    All the parts of this treatise relating to French pronunciation have
    been carefully reprinted by Mr A. J. Ellis, in his treatise "On Early
    English Pronunciation" (published by the Philological Society), Part
    III., p. 804.

    latyn by Domynike Mancyn: And translate into englysshe: at the desyre
    of syr Gyles Alyngton, knyght: by Alexander Bercley prest: and monke of

    preface to his translation of Sallust, a representation of the author
    in a monkish habit on his knees, presenting a book to a nobleman. The
    text begins on back of title. The original is printed in Roman letter
    in the margins.----Colophon in a square woodcut border: Thus endeth the

    In the British Museum, Grenville collection, from Heber's collection.
    "This edition differs materially from that used by Herbert, which has
    led Dr Dibdin to the conclusion that there were two impressions." So
    says a MS. note on the copy, (quoted in the Bib. Grenv.), but Dibdin
    does not commit himself to the conclusion, his words being these: "This
    description is given from a copy in the possession of Mr Heber; which,
    from its varying with the account of Herbert, Mr H. supposes, with
    justice, must be a different one from Herbert's." I have failed to
    discover the difference.

VI. CRONYCLE compyled in Latyn, by the renowned Sallust.----Pynson. No
date. Folio.

    "Here begynneth the famous cronycle of the warre, which the romayns had
    agaynst Jugurth, vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy. which cronycle is
    compyled in latyn by the renowmed romayne Salust. And translated into
    englysshe by syr Alexander Barclay preest, at comaundement of the right
    hye and mighty prince: Thomas duke of Northfolke." There are two
    editions by Pynson of this book.

    I. In this edition the lower half of the title page has a square
    enclosed by double lines containing the Norfolk arms, a lion rampant,
    holding a shield in his paws, on which is another lion, a cut which
    also appears on the title of The Introductory. There is a full page cut
    of the royal arms with portcullis, &c., on the back, followed by five
    pages of Table. The preface to his patron, in English,----together with
    a Latin dedication to Bishop Veysy, in parallel columns,----begins on
    the verso of signature A iiii, under a cut of the author presenting his
    book to him, the same as that which appears on the title of The myrrour
    of good maners. [See the cut prefixed to the Notice of Barclay's life,
    which is confined however to a reproduction of the two principal
    figures only, two other figures, evidently of servants, and some
    additional ornamentation of the room being omitted.] At the end of this
    preface is another cut of the author, writing at a desk; also on the
    back of the leaf is a cut of the disembarking of an army. There are no
    other cuts, but the volume is adorned throughout with very fine woodcut
    initials. Catchwords are given irregularly at the beginning, but
    regularly towards the end, at the bottom of the left hand page only,
    but the preface has them to every column. Colophon:----"Thus endeth the
    famous cronycle of the war ... imprented at London by Rycharde Pynson
    printer vnto the kynges noble grace: with priuylege vnto hym grauted by
    our sayd souerayne lorde the kynge." On the back of the last leaf is
    Pynson's device, No. v. The date is erroneously conjectured in Moss's
    Classical Bib. to be 1511. It was probably 1519, certainly between 1519
    and 1524. Contains 92 numbered leaves, and one leaf unnumbered, besides
    eight leaves of preliminary matter: numbering quite regular:
    signatures; a 8, A--O, 6 s, P, Q, 4 s. In the British Museum, Grenville
    Collection, the Bodleian, and the Public Library at Cambridge.

    Prices: Roxburghe, L23, 12s.; Sykes, L8, 12s.; Heber, L5, 15s. 6d.;
    Sotheby's, 1857, L10.

    II. In this edition, the title page is the same as in the other with
    the exception of a semicolon for a full point after Numidy, the
    succeeding which having an e added, and romayne being without the e,
    but on the back instead of a cut of the royal arms The table commences;
    the preface begins on the recto of sign. a 4, under the cut of the
    author presenting his book to the Duke of Norfolk, and ends without the
    leaf of woodcuts which is appended to the preface of the first edition.
    Pynson's device at the end of the book is also wanting in this edition.
    It contains only fol. lxxxvi., with six leaves of preliminary matter;
    the pagination is a little irregular, xxi. and xxii. are wanting but
    xxiii. is given three times, and lxxvii. is repeated for lxxviii.; the
    British Museum copy is deficient in folios lxii. and lxv.: signatures;
    a 6, A--N, 6 s, and O, P, 4 s. The initials are the same as those in
    the first edition in the great majority of cases, but appear much more
    worn. There are catch-words only at the end of every signature
    throughout the book, except to the preface, which has them to every
    column. In the British Museum, and the Public Library, Cambridge.

    Both editions have the Latin in Roman letter in the margins, and
    running-titles. Ames mentions an edition with cuts, which must be the
    same as the first of these.

VI._a._ CRONICLE OF WARRE. Compiled in Laten by Saluste. Corrected by
Thomas Paynell. Waley, 1557. Quarto.

    "Here begynneth the famous Cronicle of warre, whyche the Romaynes hadde
    agaynst Jugurth vsurper of the kyngedome of Numidie: whiche Cronicle is
    compiled in Laten by the renowmed Romayne Saluste: and translated into

    dedication--"To the ryghte honorable Lorde Antonye Vycounte Mountegue,
    Knyghte of the ryghte honorable order of the garter, and one of the
    Kynge and Queenes Magesties pryuie counsayle." "The prologue" begins on
    a 1. Barclay's preface and dedication are omitted, as well as the Latin
    of Sallust. Col.: "Thus endeth the famouse Cronicle of the warre ...
    against Jugurth ... translated... by syr Alexander Barkeley, prieste,
    at commaundemente of ... Thomas, duke of Northfolke, And imprinted at

    xxii., xxiii. for xxiv., xix., stands for xxix., lvii. is repeated, and
    lxxiv. is repeated for lxxv.

    This edition forms the second part of a volume having the following
    general title page: The Conspiracie of Catiline, written by Constancius
    Felicius Durantinus, and translated bi Thomas Paynell: with the
    historye of Jugurth, writen by the famous Romaine Salust, and
    translated into Englyshe by Alexander Barcklaye.

    Thomas was son to Gylberde Bequet a burgeys of the Cite of London. And
    was borne in y^e place, whereas now standeth the churche called saynte

    "The travels of Hayton into the Holy Land and Armenia, and his history
    of Asia, is one of the most valuable of the early accounts of the east.
    The present is the only translation into English, and from the
    circumstances of its being printed by Pynson and having been (when in
    Mr Heber's collection) bound with two other works (Mirrour of good
    Maners and Sallust) both translated by Barclay, was probably also
    translated by him. It is a book of extraordinaiy rarity, no perfect
    copy that can be traced having previously occured for sale."

Alexander Barclay excusynge the rudenes of his translacion.

  Go Boke: abasshe the thy rudenes to present.
  To men auaunced to worshyp, and honour.
  By byrthe or fortune: or to men eloquent.
  By thy submyssion excuse thy Translatour.
  But whan I remember the comon behauour
  Of men: I thynke thou ought to quake for fere
  Of tunges enuyous whose venym may the dere

  Tremble, fere, and quake, thou ought I say agayne.
  For to the Redar thou shewest by euydence
  Thy selfe of Rethoryke pryuate and barayne
  In speche superflue: and fruteles of sentence.
  Thou playnly blamest without al difference
  Bothe hye and lowe sparinge eche mannes name.
  Therfore no maruayle thoughe many do the blame.

  But if thou fortune to lye before a State
  As Kynge or Prince or Lordes great or smal.
  Or doctour diuyne or other Graduate
  Be this thy Excuse to content theyr mynde withal
  My speche is rude my termes comon and rural
  And I for rude peple moche more conuenient.
  Than for Estates, lerned men, or eloquent.

  But of this one poynt thou nedest not to fere
  That any goode man: vertuous and Just.
  Wyth his yl speche shal the hurt or dere.
  But the defende. As I suppose and trust.
  But suche Unthriftes as sue theyr carnal lust
  Whome thou for vyce dost sharply rebuke and blame
  Shal the dysprayse: emperisshinge thy name.

An exhortacion of Alexander Barclay.

  But ye that shal rede this boke: I you exhorte.
  And you that ar herars therof also I pray
  Where as ye knowe that ye be of this sorte:
  Amende your lyfe and expelle that vyce away.
  Slomber nat in syn. Amende you whyle ye may.
  And yf ye so do and ensue Vertue and grace.
  Wythin my Shyp ye get no rowme ne place.

Barclay the translatour tho the Foles.

  To Shyp galantes the se is at the ful.
  The wynde vs calleth our sayles ar displayed.
  Where may we best aryue? at Lyn or els at Hulle?
  To vs may no hauen in Englonde be denayd.
  Why tary we? the Ankers ar vp wayed.
  If any corde or Cabyl vs hurt, let outher hynder.
  Let slyp the ende, or els hewe it in sonder.

  Retourne your syght beholde vnto the shore.
  There is great nomber that fayne wold be aborde.
  They get no rowme our Shyp can holde no more.
  Haws in the Cocke gyue them none other worde.
  God gyde vs from Rockes, quicsonde tempest and forde
  If any man of warre, wether, or wynde apere.
  My selfe shal trye the wynde and kepe the Stere.

  But I pray you reders haue ye no dysdayne.
  Thoughe Barclay haue presumed of audacite
  This Shyp to rule as chefe mayster and Captayne.
  Though some thynke them selfe moche worthyer than he.
  It were great maruayle forsoth syth he hath be.
  A scoler longe: and that in dyuers scoles
  But he myght be Captayne of a Shyp of Foles

  But if that any one be in suche maner case.
  That he wyl chalange the maystershyp fro me
  Yet in my Shyp can I nat want a place.
  For in euery place my selfe I oft may se.
  But this I leue besechynge eche degre:
  To pardon my youthe and to bolde interprise.
  For harde is it duely to speke of euery vyce.

  For yf I had tunges an hundreth: and wyt to fele
  Al thinges natural and supernaturall
  A thousand mouthes: and voyce as harde as stele.
  And sene all the seuen Sciences lyberal.
  Yet cowde I neuer touche the vyces all.
  And syn of the worlde: ne theyr braunches comprehende:
  Nat thoughe I lyued vnto the worldes ende.

  But if these vyces whiche mankynde doth incomber.
  Were clene expellyd and vertue in theyr place.
  I cowde nat haue gathered of fowles so great a nomber.

[The Prologe of James Locher.]

After that I haue longe mused by my self of the sore confounded and
vncertayne cours of mannys lyfe, and thinges therto belonginge: at the last
I haue by my vigilant meditacion found and noted many degrees of errours:
wherby mankynd wandreth from the way of trouth I haue also noted that many
wyse men and wel lettred haue writen right fruteful doctrines: wherby they
haue heled these dyseses and intollerable perturbacions of the mynde: and
the goostly woundes therof, moche better than Esculapius which was fyrst
Inuentour of Phesyke and amonge the Gentyles worshypped as a God. In the
contrey of Grece were stodyes fyrst founded and ordeyned in the which began
and sprange holsom medicyne which gaue vnto infect myndes frutful doctryne
and norisshinge. Amonge whome Socrates that great begynner and honourer of
wysdom began to dispute of ye maners of men. But for that he coude nat
fynde certayne ende of goodnes and hyest felicite in naturall thinges: nor
induce men to the same, he gaue the hye contemplacions of his mynde to
moral vertues. And in so moche passed he al other in Philosophy moral that
it was sayde that he called Philosophy down from the Imperial heuen. whan
this Socrates perceyued the mindes of men to be prone, and extremely
inclyned to viciousnes he had gret affeccion to subdue suche maners.
Wherfore in comon places of the Cyte of Athenes he instruct and infourmed
the peple in such doctrynes as compasith the clere and immaculate welles of
the moste excellent and souerayne gode. After the disces of Socrates
succeded ye godly Plato whiche in moral Philosophy ouerpassed also a great
part of his tyme And certaynly nat without a cause was he called godly. For
by what stody myght be more holely or better socour mankynde than by suche
doctrynes as he gaue. He wrote and ordeyned lawes moste egal and iust He
edityed vnto the Grekes a comon welthe stable, quyet and commendable. And
ordeyned the societe and company of them most iocund and amyable. He
prepared a brydel to refrayne the lust and sensualyte of the body. And
fynally he changed the yl ignorance feblenes and negligence of youth vnto
dylygence, strength and vertue. In tyme also of these Phylosophers sprange
the florisshynge age of Poetes: whiche amonge lettred men had nat smal
rowme and place. And that for theyr eloquent Retoryke and also for theyr
mery ficcions and inuencions. Of the whiche Poetes some wrote in moste
ornate termes in ditees heroycal wherin the noble actes and lyues both of
dyuyne and humayne creatures ar wont to be noted and writem. Some wrote of
tylling of the grounde. Some of the Planetes, of the courses of ye sterres:
and of the mouynge of the heuyn and fyrmament. Some of the Empyre and
shameful subieccion of disordred loue. And many other of the myserable
ruyne and fal of Kynges and princes for vice: as Tragedies. And some other
wrote Comedyes with great libertye of speche: which Comedies we cal
Interludes. Amonge whome Aristophanes Eupolis and Cratinus mooste laudable
Poetes passed al other. For whan they sawe the youth of Athenes and of al
the remanent of Grece inclyned to al ylles they toke occasion to note suche
myslyuinge. And so in playne wordes they repreued without fauour the vyces
of the sayd yl disposyd peple of what condicion or order they were: Of this
auncient wrytinge of Comedyes our laten Poetes deuysed a maner of wrytinge
nat inelegant. And fyrst Lucilius composed one Satyre in the whiche he
wrote by name the vices of certayne princes and Citezyns of Rome And that
with many bourdes so y^t with his mery speche myxt with rebukes he correct
al them of the cyte that disordredly lyued. But this mery speche vsed he
nat in his writing to the intent to excercyse wanton wordes or vnrefrayned
lascyuyte, or to put his pleasour in suche dissolute langage: but to ye
intent to quenche vyces and to prouoke the commons to wysdome and vertue,
and to be asshamed of theyr foly and excessyfe lyuynge. of hym all the
Latyn poetes haue takyn example, and begynnynge to wryte Satyrs whiche the
grekes named Comedyes: As Fabius specifyeth in his X boke of institucions.
After Lucilius succeded Horacius, moche more eloquent in wrytynge whiche in
the same deseruyd great laude: Persius also left to vs onely one boke by
the whiche he commyttyd his name and laude to perpetuall memory. The last
and prynce of all was Juuenall whiche in his iocunde poemys comprehendyd al
that was wryten most eloquent and pleasaunt of all the poetis of that sorte
afore his tyme: O noble men, and diligent hertes and myndes, o laudable
maners and tymes, these worthy men exyled ydelnes, wherby they haue
obtayned nat small worshyp and great commodyte example and doctryne lefte
to vs theyr posteryours why begyn we nat to vnderstonde and perceyue. Why
worshyp nat the people of our tyme these poetis why do nat they reuerence
to ye interpretours of them do they nat vnderstonde: that no poetes wryte,
but outher theyr mynde is to do pleasure or els profyte to the reder, or
ellys they togyther wyll doo bothe profyte and pleasoure why are they
dyspysed of many rude carters of nowe a dayes which vnderstonde nat them,
And for lacke of them haue nat latyn to vtter and expresse ye wyl of their
mynde. Se whether poetes ar to be dispised. they laude vertue and hym that
vseth it rebukyng vices with the vsers therof, They teche what is good and
what is euyll: to what ende vyce, and what ende vertue bringeth vs, and do
nat Poetis reuyle and sharply byte in their poemys all suche as ar vnmeke,
Prowde, Couetous, Lecherous, Wanton, delycyous, Wrathfull glotons, wasters,
Enuyours, Enchauntours, faythebrakers, rasshe, vnauysed, malapert, drunken,
vntaught foles, and suche lyke. Shulde theyr writyng that suche thinges
disprayse and reuyle be dyspised of many blynde Dotardes y^t nowe lyue
whiche enuy that any man shulde haue or vnderstonde ye thyng whiche they
knowe nat. The Poetes also wyth great lawdes commende and exalt the noble
folowers of vertue ascribyng to euery man rewardes after his merytes. And
shortly to say, the intencion of al Poetes hath euer ben to repreue vyce:
and to commende vertue. But syns it is so that nowe in our dayes ar so many
neglygent and folysshe peple that they ar almost innumerable whiche
despisynge the loue of vertue: folowe the blyndenes and vanyte of this
worlde: it was expedient that of newe some lettred man, wyse, and subtil of
wyt shulde awake and touche ye open vices of foles that now lyue: and blame
theyr abhomynable lyfe. This fourme and lybertye of writinge, and charge
hathe taken vpon hym the Right excellent and worthy Mayster Sebastian Brant
Doctour of both the Lawes and noble Oratour and Poete to the comon welthe
of al people in playne and comon speche of Doche in the contrey of Almayne:
to the ymytacion of Dant Florentyne: and Francis Petrarche Poetes heroycal
which in their maternal langage haue composed maruelous Poemes and
ficcions. But amonge diuers inuencions composed of the sayde Sebastian
brant I haue noted one named ye Shyp of Foles moche expedient and necessary
to the redar which the sayd Sebastian composed in doche langage. And after
hym one called James Locher his Disciple translated the same into Laten to
the vnderstondinge of al Christen nacions where Laten is spoken. Than
another (whose name to me is vnknowen) translated the same into Frenche. I
haue ouersene the fyrst Inuencion in Doche and after that the two
translations in Laten and Frenche whiche in blaminge the disordred lyfe of
men of our tyme agreeth in sentence: threfolde in langage wherfore wylling
to redres the errours and vyces of this oure Royalme of Englonde: as the
foresayde composer and translatours hath done in theyr Contrees I haue
taken vpon me: howbeit vnworthy to drawe into our Englysshe tunge the sayd
boke named ye shyp of folys as nere to ye sayd thre Langages as the parcyte
of my wyt wyll suffer me. But ye reders gyue ye pardon vnto Alexander de
Barklay If ignoraunce negligence or lacke of wyt cause hym to erre in this
translacion his purpose and synguler desyre is to content youre myndes. And
sothely he hathe taken vpon hym the translacion of this present Boke
neyther for hope of rewarde nor lawde of man: but onely for the holsome
instruccion commodyte and Doctryne of wysdome, and to clense the vanyte and
madnes of folysshe people of whom ouer great nombre is in the Royalme of
Englonde. Therfore let euery man beholde and ouerrede this boke: And than I
doute nat but he shal se the errours of his lyfe of what condycyon that he
be. in lyke wyse as he shal se in a Myrrour the fourme of his countenaunce
and vysage: And if he amende suche fautes as he redeth here wherein he
knoweth hymself gylty, and passe forth the resydue of his lyfe in the order
of good maners than shall he haue the fruyte and auauntage wherto I haue
translatyd this boke.

Here begynneth the prologe.

  Amonge the people of euery regyon
  And ouer the worlde, south north eest and west
  Soundeth godly doctryne in plenty and foyson
  Wherin the grounde of vertue and wysdome doth rest
  Rede gode and bad, and kepe the to the best
  Was neuer more plenty of holsome doctryne
  Nor fewer people that doth therto enclyne

  We haue the Bybyll whiche godly doth expresse
  Of the olde testament the lawes mysticall
  And also of the newe our erour to redresse
  Of phylosophy and other artes liberall
  With other bokes of vertues morall
  But thoughe suche bokes vs godly wayes shewe
  We all ar blynde no man wyll them ensue

  Banysshed is doctryne, we wander in derknes
  Throughe all the worlde: our selfe we wyll not knowe
  Wysdome is exyled, alas blynde folysshenes
  Mysgydeth the myndes of people hye and lowe
  Grace is decayed, yll governaunce doth growe
  Both prudent Pallas and Minerua are slayne
  Or els to heuyn retourned are they agayne

  Knowledge of trouth, Prudence, and iust Symplicite
  Hath vs clene left: For we set of them no store.
  Our Fayth is defyled loue, goodnes, and Pyte:
  Honest maners nowe ar reputed of: no more.
  Lawyers ar lordes: but Justice is rent and tore.
  Or closed lyke a Monster within dores thre.
  For without mede: or money no man can hyr se.

  Al is disordred: Vertue hathe no rewarde.
  Alas, Compassion: and Mercy bothe ar slayne.
  Alas, the stony hartys of pepyl ar so harde
  That nought can constrayne theyr folyes to refrayne
  But styl they procede: and eche other meyntayne.
  So wander these foles: incresinge without nomber.
  That al the worlde they vtterly encomber.

  Blasphemers of Chryst; Hostlers; and Tauerners:
  Crakars and bosters with Courters auenterous,
  Bawdes and Pollers with comon extorcioners
  Ar taken nowe adayes in the worlde moste glorious.
  But the gyftes of grace and al wayes gracious
  We haue excluded. Thus lyue we carnally:
  Utterly subdued to al lewdnes and Foly.

  Thus is of Foles a sorte almost innumerable.
  Defilynge the worlde with syn and Vylany.
  Some thynkinge them self moche wyse and commendable
  Thoughe al theyr dayes they lyue vnthryftely.
  No goodnes they perceyue nor to no goode aplye.
  But if he haue a great wombe, and his Cofers ful
  Than is none holde wyser bytwene London and Hul.

  But to assemble these Foles in one bonde.
  And theyr demerites worthely to note.
  Fayne shal I Shyppes of euery maner londe.
  None shalbe left: Barke, Galay, Shyp, nor Bote.
  One vessel can nat brynge them al aflote.
  For yf al these Foles were brought into one Barge
  The bote shulde synke so sore shulde be the charge.

  The sayles ar hawsed, a pleasant cole dothe blowe.
  The Foles assembleth as fast as they may dryue.
  Some swymmeth after: other as thycke doth rowe
  In theyr small botes, as Bees about a hyue
  The nomber is great, and eche one doth stryue
  For to be chefe as Purser and Capytayne
  Quarter mayster, Lodesman or els Boteswayne.

  They ron to our shyp, eche one doth greatly fere
  Lyst his slacke paas, sholde cause hym byde behynde
  The wynde ryseth, and is lyke the sayle to tere
  Eche one enforseth the anker vp to wynde
  The se swellyth by planettes well I fynde
  These obscure clowdes threteneth vs tempest
  All are nat in bed whiche shall haue yll rest

  We are full lade and yet forsoth I thynke
  A thousand are behynde, whom we may not receyue
  For if we do, our nauy clene shall synke
  He oft all lesys that coueytes all to haue
  From London Rockes almyghty god vs saue
  For if we there anker, outher bote or barge
  There be so many that they vs wyll ouercharge

  Ye London Galantes, arere, ye shall nat enter
  We kepe the streme, and touche nat the shore
  In Cyte nor in Court we dare nat well auenter
  Lyst perchaunce we sholde displeasure haue therfore
  But if ye wyll nedes some shall haue an ore
  And all the remenaunt shall stande afar at large
  And rede theyr fautes paynted aboute our barge.

  Lyke as a myrrour doth represent agayne
  The fourme and fygure of mannes countenaunce
  So in our shyp shall he se wrytyn playne
  The fourme and fygure of his mysgouernaunce
  What man is fautles, but outher ignoraunce
  Or els wylfulnes causeth hym offende:
  Than let hym nat disdayne this shyp, tyll he amende.

  And certaynly I thynke that no creature
  Lyuynge in this lyfe mortall in transytory
  Can hym self kepe and stedfastly endure
  Without all spot, as worthy eternall glory
  But if he call to his mynde and memory
  Fully the dedys both of his youthe and age
  He wyll graunt in this shyp to kepe some stage

  But who so euer wyll knowlege his owne foly
  And it repent, lyuynge after in sympylnesse
  Shall haue no place nor rowme more in our nauy
  But become felawe to pallas the goddesse
  But he that fyxed is in suche a blyndnesse
  That thoughe he be nought he thynketh al is well
  Suche shall in this Barge bere a babyll and a bell

  These with other lyke may eche man se and rede
  Eche by themselfe in this small boke ouerall
  The fautes shall he fynde if he take good hede
  Of all estatis as degres temporall
  With gyders of dignytees spirituall
  Bothe pore and riche, Chorles and Cytezyns
  For hast to lepe a borde many bruse theyr shynnys

  Here is berdles youth, and here is crokyd age
  Children with theyr faders that yll do them insygne
  And doth nat intende theyr wantones to swage
  Nouther by worde nor yet by discyplyne
  Here be men of euery science and doctryne
  Lerned and vnlerned man mayde chylde and wyfe
  May here se and rede the lewdenes of theyr lyfe.

  Here ar vyle wymen: whome loue Immoderate
  And lust Venereall bryngeth to hurt and shame.
  Here ar prodigal Galantes: wyth mouers of debate.
  And thousandes mo: whome I nat wel dare name.
  Here ar Bacbyters whiche goode lyuers dyffame.
  Brakers of wedlocke, men proude: and couetous:
  Pollers, and pykers with folke delicious.

  It is but foly to rehers the names here
  Of al suche Foles: as in one Shelde or targe.
  Syns that theyr foly dystynctly shal apere
  On euery lefe: in Pyctures fayre and large.
  To Barclays stody: and Pynsones cost and charge
  Wherfore ye redars pray that they both may be saued
  Before God, syns they your folyes haue thus graued.

  But to thentent that euery man may knowe
  The cause of my wrytynge: certes I intende
  To profyte and to please both hye and lowe
  And blame theyr fautes wherby they may amende
  But if that any his quarell wyll defende
  Excusynge his fautes to my derysyon
  Knowe he that noble poetes thus haue done.

  Afore my dayes a thousande yere ago
  Blamynge and reuylynge the inconuenyence
  Of people, wyllynge them to withdrawe therfro
  Them I ensue: nat lyke of intellygence
  And though I am nat to them lyke in science
  Yet this is my wyll mynde and intencion
  To blame all vyce lykewyse as they haue done.

  To tender youth my mynde is to auayle
  That they eschewe may all lewdenes and offence
  Whiche doth theyr myndes often sore assayle
  Closynge the iyen of theyr intellygence
  But if I halt in meter or erre in eloquence
  Or be to large in langage I pray you blame nat me
  For my mater is so bad it wyll none other be.

[The Argument.]

Here after foloweth the Boke named the Shyp of Foles of the world:
translated out of Laten, French and Doche into Englysse in the Colege of
saynt Mary Otery By me Alexander Barclay to the felicite and moste holsom
instruccion of mankynde the whiche conteyneth al suche as wandre from the
way of trouth and from the open Path of holsom vnderstondynge and wysdom:
fallynge into dyuers blyndnesses of ye mynde, folysshe sensualytees, and
vndlawful delectacions of the body. This present Boke myght haue ben callyd
nat inconuenyently the Satyr (that is to say) the reprehencion of
foulysshnes, but the neweltye of the name was more plesant vnto the fyrst
actour to call it the Shyp of foles: For in lyke wyse as olde Poetes
Satyriens in dyuers Poesyes conioyned repreued the synnes and ylnes of the
peple at that tyme lyuynge: so and in lyke wyse this our Boke representeth
vnto the iyen of the redars the states and condicions of men: so that euery
man may behold within the same the cours of his lyfe and his mysgouerned
maners, as he sholde beholde the shadowe of the fygure of his visage within
a bright Myrrour. But concernynge the translacion of this Boke: I exhort ye
reders to take no displesour for y^t it is nat translated word by worde
acordinge to ye verses of my actour. For I haue but only drawen into our
moder tunge, in rude langage the sentences of the verses as nere as the
parcyte of my wyt wyl suffer me, some tyme addynge, somtyme detractinge and
takinge away suche thinges a semeth me necessary and superflue. wherfore I
desyre of you reders pardon of my presumptuous audacite trustynge that ye
shall holde me excused if ye consyder ye scarsnes of my wyt and my vnexpert
youthe. I haue in many places ouerpassed dyuers poetical digressions and
obscurenes of Fables and haue concluded my worke in rude langage as shal
apere in my translacion. But the speciyl cawse that mouethe me to this
besynes is to auoyde the execrable inconuenyences of ydilnes whyche (as
saint Bernard sayth) is moder of al vices: and to the vtter derision of
obstynat men delitynge them in folyes and mysgouernance. But bycause the
name of this boke semeth to the redar to procede of derysion: and by that
mean that the substance therof shulde nat be profitable: I wyl aduertise
you that this Boke is named the Shyp of foles of the worlde: For this
worlde is nought els but a tempestous se in the whiche we dayly wander and
are caste in dyuers tribulacions paynes and aduersitees: some by ignoraunce
and some by wilfulnes: wherfore suche doers ar worthy to be called foles.
syns they gyde them nat by reason as creatures resonable ought to do.
Therfore the fyrst actoure willynge to deuyde suche foles from wysemen and
gode lyuers: hathe ordeyned vpon the se of this worlde this present Shyp to
contayne these folys of ye worlde, whiche ar in great nomber. So that who
redeth it perfytely consyderynge his secrete dedys, he shall not lyghtly
excuse hym selfe out of it, what so euer good name y^t he hath outwarde in
the mouth of the comontye, And to the entent y^t this my laboure may be the
more pleasaunt vnto lettred men, I haue adioyned vnto the same ye verses of
my Actour with dyuerse concordaunces of the Bybyll to fortyfy my wrytynge
by the same, and also to stop the enuyous mouthes (If any suche shal be) of
them that by malyce shall barke ayenst this my besynes.

  But if it fortune that any lernyd men

  Sythe many ar whiche stody right besely

  But if I durst trouth playnely vtter and expresse.
  This is the special cause of this Inconuenyence.

Of euyl Counsellours, Juges and men of lawe.

[Illustration: He that Office hath and hyghe autorite.
To rule a Royalme: as Juge or Counsellour
Which seynge Justice, playne ryght and equyte
Them falsly blyndeth by fauour or rigour
Condemnynge wretches gyltles. And to a Transgressour
For mede shewinge fauour. Suche is as wyse a man
As he that wolde seeth a quycke Sowe in a Pan.]

  Right many labours nowe, with hyghe diligence
  For to be Lawyers the Comons to counsayle.
  Therby to be in honour had and in reuerence
  But onely they labour for theyr pryuate auayle.
  The purs of the Clyent shal fynde hym apparayle.
  And yet knowes he neyther lawe good counsel nor Justice.
  But speketh at auenture: as men throwe the dyce.

  Suche in the Senate ar taken oft to counsayle
  With Statis of this and many a other region.
  Whiche of theyr maners vnstable ar and frayle
  Nought of Lawe Ciuyl knowinge nor Canon.
  But wander in derknes clerenes they haue none.
  O noble Rome thou gat nat thy honours
  Nor general Empyre by suche Counsellours.

  Whan noble Rome all the worlde dyd gouerne
  Theyr councellers were olde men iust and prudent
  Whiche egally dyd euery thynge descerne
  Wherby theyr Empyre became so excellent
  But nowe a dayes he shall haue his intent
  That hath most golde, and so it is befall
  That aungels worke wonders in westmynster hall.

  There cursyd coyne makyth the wronge seme right
  The cause of hym that lyueth in pouertye
  Hath no defence, tuycion, strength nor myght
  Suche is the olde custome of this faculte
  That colours oft cloke Justyce and equyte
  None can the mater fele nor vnderstonde
  Without the aungell be weyghty in his honde

  Thus for the hunger of syluer and of golde
  Justyce and right is in captyuyte
  And as we se nat gyuen fre, but solde
  Nouther to estates, nor sympell comonte
  And though that many lawyers rightwysnes be
  Yet many other dysdayne to se the ryght
  And they ar suche as blynde Justycis syght

  There is one and other alleged at the barre
  And namely suche as chrafty were in glose
  Upon the lawe: the clyentis stande afarre
  Full lytell knowynge howe the mater goose
  And many other the lawes clene transpose
  Folowynge the example, of lawyers dede and gone
  Tyll the pore Clyentis be etyn to the bone

  It is not ynough to conforme thy mynde
  Unto the others faynyd opynyon
  Thou sholde say trouthe, so Justyce doth the bynde
  And also lawe gyueth the commyssyon
  To knowe hir, and kepe hir without transgressyon
  Lyst they whome thou hast Juged wrongfully
  Unto the hye Juge for vengeaunce on the crye.

  Perchaunce thou thynkest that god taketh no hede
  To mannes dedys, nor workes of offence
  Yes certaynly he knowes thy thought and dede
  No thynge is secrete, nor hyd from his presence
  Wherefore if thou wylt gyde the by prudence
  Or thou gyue Jugement of mater lesse or more
  Take wyse mennys reade and good counsayle before

  Loke in what Balance, what weyght and what mesure
  Thou seruest other. for thou shalt serued be
  With the same after this lyfe I the ensure.
  If thou ryghtwysly Juge by lawe and equyte
  Thou shalt haue presence of goddes hyghe maiestye
  But if thou Juge amys: than shall Eacus
  (As Poetis sayth) hell Juge thy rewarde discusse

  God is aboue and regneth sempiternally.
  Whiche shall vs deme at his last Jugement,
  And gyue rewardes to echone egally
  After suche fourme as he his lyfe hath spent
  Than shall we them se whome we as violent
  Traytours: haue put to wronge in worde or dede
  And after our deserte euen suche shall be our mede

  There shall be no Bayle nor treatynge of maynpryse
  Ne worldly wysdome there shall no thynge preuayle
  There shall be no delayes vntyll another Syse
  But outher quyt, or to infernall Gayle.
  Ill Juges so iuged, Lo here theyr trauayle
  Worthely rewarded in wo withouten ende.
  Than shall no grace be graunted ne space to amende.

  Therfore ye yonge Studentes of the Chauncery:
  (I speke nat to the olde the Cure of them is past)
  Remember that Justyce longe hath in bondage be
  Reduce ye hir nowe vnto lybertye at the last.
  Endeuer you hir bondes to louse or to brast
  Hir raunsome is payde and more by a thousande pounde
  And yet alas the lady Justyce lyeth bounde.

  Thoughe your fore Faders haue take hir prysoner
  And done hir in a Dongeon nat mete for hir degre
  Lay to your handes and helpe hir from daungere
  And hir restore vnto hir lybertye
  That pore men and monyles may hir onys se
  But certaynly I fere lyst she hath lost hir name
  Or by longe prysonment shall after euer be lame.

Of Auaryce or Couetyse and prodygalyte.

[Illustration: Ye that ar gyuen ouer moche to Couetyse
Come nere, a place is here for you to dwel
Come nere ye wastfull people in lyke wyse
Youre rowme shall be hye in the Topcastell
Ye care for no shame, for heuen nor for hell
Golde is your god, ryches gotten wrongfully
Ye dame your soule, and yet lyue in penury.]

  He that is besy euery day and houre
  Without mesure, maner, or moderacion
  To gather riches and great store of treasoure
  Therof no ioy takinge, confort nor consolacion.
  He is a Fole: and of blynde and mad opynyon
  For that which he getteth and kepeth wrongfully
  His heyre often wasteth moche more vnthryftely.

  While he here lyueth in this lyfe caduke and mortal.
  Ful sore he laboureth: and oft hungry gothe to bed
  Sparinge from hymselfe: for hym that neuer shal
  After do hym goode. thoughe he were harde bested.
  Thus is this Couetous wretche so blyndly led
  By the fende that here he lyueth wretchydly
  And after his deth damned eternally.

  There wandreth he in dolour and derknes
  Amonge infernall flodes tedyous and horryble
  Let se what auayleth than all his ryches
  Ungracyously gotyne, his paynes ar terryble
  Than wolde he amende but it is inpossyble
  In hell is no order nor hope of remedy
  But sorowe vpon sorowe, and that euerlastyngly.

  Yet fynde I another vyce as bad as this
  Whiche is the vyce of prodygalyte
  He spendyth all in ryot and amys
  Without all order, pursuynge pouertye
  He lyketh nat to lyue styll in prosperite
  But all and more he wastyth out at large
  (Beware the ende) is the leste poynt of his charge.

  But of the couetous somwhat to say agayne
  Thou art a fole thy soule to sell for riches
  Or put thy body to labour or to payne
  Thy mynde to fere, thy herte to heuynesse
  Thou fole thou fleest no maner cruelnesse
  So thou may get money, to make thy heyr a knyght
  Thou sleest thy soule where as thou saue it myght

  Thou hast no rest thy mynde is euer in fere
  Of mysauenture, nor neuer art content
  Deth is forgoten, thou carest nat a here
  To saue thy soule from infernall punysshement
  If thou be dampned, than art thou at thy stent
  By thy ryches which thou here hast left behynde
  To thy executours, thou shalt small comforte fynde

  Theyr custome is to holde fast that they haue
  Thy pore soule shall be farthest fro theyr thought
  If that thy carkes be brought onys in the graue
  And that they haue thy bagges in handes cought
  What say they, than (by god the man had nought)
  Whyle he here lyuyd he was to lyberall
  Thus dampned is thy soule, thy ryches cause of all

  Who wyll denay but it is necesary
  Of riches for to haue plenty and store
  To this opynyon I wyll nat say contrary
  So it be ordred after holy lore
  Whyle thy selfe leuest departe some to the pore
  With thy owne hande trust nat thy executours
  Gyue for god, and god shall sende at all houres

  Rede Tullius warkes the worthy Oratour.
  And writen shalt thou fynde in right fruteful sentence
  That neuer wyseman loued ouer great honour.
  Nor to haue great riches put ouer great diligence
  But onely theyr mynde was set on Sapience
  And quyetly to lyue in Just symplycite.
  For in greatest honour is greatest ieoperdye.

  He that is symple, and on the grounde doth lye
  And that can be content with ynoughe or suffisaunce
  Is surer by moche than he that lyeth on hye.
  Nowe vp nowe downe vnsure as a Balaunce.
  But sothly he that set wyll his plesance
  Onely on wysdom and styl therfore labour.
  Shal haue more goode than all erthly tresour.

  Wysdom techeth to eschewe al offence.
  Gydynge mankynde the ryght way to vertue.
  But of couetyse Comys all Inconuenyence.
  It cawseth man of worde to be vntrue.
  Forswerynge and falshode doth it also ensue.
  Brybery and Extorcion, murder and myschefe.
  Shame is his ende: his lyuyinge is reprefe.

  By couetyse Crassus brought was to his ende.
  By it the worthy Romayns lost theyr name.
  Of this one yl a thousand ylles doth descende.
  Besyde enuy, Pryde, wretchydnes and Shame.
  Crates the Philosopher dyd Couetyse so blame:
  That to haue his mynde vnto his stody fre.
  He threwe his Tresour all hole into the see.

  But shortly to conclude. Both bodely bondage.
  And gostly also: procedeth of this couetyse.
  The soule is damned the body hath damage
  As hunger, thyrst, and colde with other preiudice.
  Bereft of the ioyes of heuenly Paradyse.
  For golde was theyr god and that is left behynde
  Theyr bodyes beryed the soule clene out of mynde

  Amende thy selfe ryse out of this blyndenes.

Moche yl example to yonge Comontye.

And comonly it is sene that nowe a dayes
One Fole gladly folowes anothers wayes.]

  Drawe nere ye Courters and Galants disgised
  Ye counterfayt Caytifs, that ar nat content
  As god hath you made: his warke is despysed
  Ye thynke you more crafty than God onipotent.
  Unstable is your mynde: that shewes by your garment.
  A fole is knowen by his toyes and his Cote.
  But by theyr clothinge nowe may we many note.

  Aparayle is apayred. Al sadness is decayde
  The garmentes ar gone that longed to honestye.
  And in newe sortes newe Foles ar arayede
  Despisynge the costom of good antiquyte.
  Mannys fourme is disfigured with euery degre
  As Knyght Squyer yeman Jentilman and knaue,
  For al in theyr goynge vngoodely them behaue

  The tyme hath ben, nat longe before our dayes
  Whan men with honest ray coude holde them self content.
  Without these disgised: and counterfayted wayes.
  Wherby theyr goodes ar wasted, loste, and spent.
  Socrates with many mo in wysdom excellent.
  Bycause they wolde nought change that cam of nature
  Let growe theyre here without cuttinge or scissure.

  At that tyme was it reputed to lawde and great honour.
  To haue longe here: the Beerde downe to the brest
  For so they vsed that were of moste valour.
  Stryuynge together who myht be godlyest
  Saddest, moste clenely, discretest, and moste honest.
  But nowe adayes together we contende and stryue.
  Who may be gayest: and newest wayes contryue.

  Fewe kepeth mesure, but excesse and great outrage
  In theyr aparayle. And so therin they procede
  That theyr goode is spent: theyr Londe layde to morgage.
  Or solde out right: of Thryft they take no hede.
  Hauinge no Peny them to socour at theyr nede.
  So whan theyr goode by suche wastefulnes is loste.
  They sel agayne theyr Clothes for half that they coste.

  A fox furred Jentelman: of the fyrst yere or hede.
  If he be made a Bailyf a Clerke or a Constable.
  And can kepe a Parke or Court and rede a Dede
  Than is Ueluet to his state mete and agreable.
  Howbeit he were more mete to here a Babyl.
  For his Foles Hode his iyen so sore doth blynde
  That Pryde expelleth his lynage from his mynde.

  Yet fynde I another sort almoste as bad as thay.
  As yonge Jentylmen descended of worthy Auncetry.
  Whiche go ful wantonly in dissolute aray.
  Counterfayt, disgised, and moche vnmanerly
  Blasinge and garded: to lowe or else to hye.
  And wyde without mesure: theyr stuffe to wast thus gothe
  But other some they suffer to dye for lacke of clothe.

  Some theyr neckes charged with colers, and chaynes
  As golden withtthes: theyr fyngers ful of rynges:
  Theyr neckes naked: almoste vnto the raynes
  Theyr sleues blasinge lyke to a Cranys wynges
  Thus by this deuysinge suche counterfayted thinges
  They dysfourme that figure that god hymselfe hath made
  On pryde and abusion thus ar theyr myndes layde.

  Than the Courters careles that on theyr mayster wayte
  Seinge hym his Uesture in suche fourme abuse
  Assayeth suche Fassion for them to counterfayte.
  And so to sue Pryde contynually they muse.
  Than stele they; or Rubbe they. Forsoth they can nat chuse.
  For without Londe or Labour harde is it to mentayne.
  But to thynke on the Galows that is a careful payne.

  But be it payne or nat: there many suche ende.
  At Newgate theyr garmentis ar offred to be solde.
  Theyr bodyes to the Jebet solemly ascende.
  Wauynge with the wether whyle theyr necke wyl holde.
  But if I shulde wryte al the ylles manyfolde.
  That procedeth of this counterfayt abusion
  And mysshapen Fassions: I neuer shulde haue done.

  For both States, comons, man, woman, and chylde
  Ar vtterly inclyed to this inconuenyence.
  But namely therwith these Courters are defyled.
  Bytwen mayster and man I fynde no dyfference.
  Therfore ye Courters knowledge your offence.
  Do nat your errour mentayne, support nor excuse.
  For Fowles ye ar your Rayment thus to abuse.

  To Shyp Galauntes come nere I say agayne.
  Wyth your set Busshes Curlynge as men of Inde.
  Ye counterfayted Courters come with your fleinge brayne
  Expressed by these variable Garmentes that ye fynde.
  To tempt chast Damsels and turne them to your mynde
  Your breste ye discouer and necke. Thus your abusion
  Is the Fendes bate. And your soules confusion.

  Come nere disgysed foles: receyue your Foles Hode.
  And ye that in sondry colours ar arayde.
  Ye garded galantes wastinge thus your goode
  Come nere with your Shertes brodered and displayed.
  In fourme of Surplys. Forsoth it may be sayde.
  That of your Sort right fewe shal thryue this yere.
  Or that your faders werith suche Habyte in the Quere.

  And ye Jentyl wymen whome this lewde vice doth blynde
  Lased on the backe: your peakes set a loft.
  Come to my Shyp. forget ye nat behynde.
  Your Sadel on the tayle: yf ye lyst to sit soft.
  Do on your Decke Slut: if ye purpos to come oft.
  I mean your Copyntanke: And if it wyl do no goode.
  To kepe you from the rayne. ye shall haue a foles hode.

  By the ale stake knowe we the ale hous
  And euery Jnne is knowen by the sygne
  So a lewde woman and a lechcrous
  Is knowen by hir clothes, be they cours or fyne
  Folowynge newe fassyons, not graunted by doctryne
  The bocher sheweth his flesshe it to sell
  So doth these women dampnyng theyr soule to hell

  What shall I more wryte of our enormyte
  Both man and woman as I before haue sayde
  Ar rayde and clothyd nat after theyr degre
  As nat content with the shape that god hath made
  The clenlynes of Clergye is nere also decayed.

  But if all the Foly of our Hole Royalme were named
  Of mys apparayle of Olde, young, lowe, and hye,
  The tyme shulde fayle: and space to me denye.

  And of wymen also disfourmynge theyr fygure.
  Wors than the Turkes, Jewes, or Sarazyns.

  Thou blynde dodart these wordes holde thou styll

  He that can yll as well myght lerne goodnes

  A yonge hert is as apt to take wysdome
  As is an olde, and if it rotyd be

  But that styll after some spot wyll byde within
  A lytell twygge plyant is by kynde
  A bygger braunche is harde to bowe or wynde
  But suffer the braunche to a byg tre to growe
  And rather it shall brake than outher wynde or bowe

  And oft thou trustest: and hast a stedfast hope
  To se thy son promoted nere as hye as is the Pope
  But yet perchaunce mourne thou shalt ful sore.
  For his shameful ende: fortuned for lacke of lore.

  Some folowe theyr chyldrens wyl and lewde plesour
  So grauntinge them theyr mynde: that after it doth fal
  To theyr great shame: they sorowe and dolour
  As dyd to Priamus a Kynge Imperial
  Whiche suffred his men: his son chefe of them al
  By force from Grece to robbe the fayre Helayne.
  Wherby both Fader and son were after slayne.

  With noble Hector and many thousandes mo.
  The Cyte of Troy vnto the ground clene brent.
  I rede in the Cronycles of the Romayns also
  Howe Tarquyne the proude had shame and punysshment
  For rauysshynge chaste Lucres agaynst hyr assent.
  Wherfore hyrselfe she slewe hyr seynge thus defiled.
  For the which dede this Tarquyn was exiled,

  From Rome: wandrynge in the Costes of Italy.
  Dyd nat the traytour Catelyne also conspyre
  And many mo sworne to his cruel tyranny
  Agaynst the Romans to oppresse theyr Impyre,
  But he and all his were murdred for theyr hyre,
  And nat vnworthely. Beholde wherto they come
  Which ar nat enfourmed in youth to ensue wysdom.

  The son oft foloweth the faders behauour
  And if the fader be discrete and vertuous.
  The son shal suche wayes practyse both day and hour.
  But if that the fader be lewde and vicious
  By falshode lyuynge: and by wayes cautelous.
  The son also the same wayes wyl ensue
  And that moche rather than goodnes or vertue

  Therfore it nedeth that better prouysion.
  Were founde for youthe by sad and wyse counsayle
  Far from theyr faders of this condicion.
  And other lewde gydes which myght theyr myndes assayle
  Greuously wyth syn. So were it theyr auayle
  From theyr faders frawde and falshode to declyne
  And them submyt to some lawdable mannys doctryne.

  Peleus, somtyme a noble and worthy kynge
  Subdued Achylles vnto the doctryne
  Of phenix whiche was both worthy and cunnynge
  Wherfore Achyllys right gladly dyd enclyne
  With his hert and mynde vnto his disciplyne
  Wherby his name so noble was at the last
  That all Asy in worthynes he past

  Ryght so Philippus a kynge worthy of name
  Ouer all Grece made great iniquicion
  To fynde one wyse, sad and laudable of fame
  To Alexander his sonne for to gyue Instruccion
  Founde was great Aristotyl at the conclusion
  Disciple of Plato. whiche in euery Science.
  Infourmed this chylde with parfyte diligence.

  Whiche Alexander afterward had so great dignyte.
  What by his strength, his cunnynge, and boldenes.
  That he was lorde both of Londe and See.
  And none durst rebel aganst his worthynes.
  Lo here the lawde, the honour, and nobles.
  Which dothe procede of vertue and doctryne
  But few ar the faders that nowe hereto inclyne

  Fewe ar that forceth nowe adayes to se
  Theyr chyldren taught: or to do any cost
  On som sad man, wyse, and of auctorite:
  Al that is theron bestowed thynke they loste.
  The folyssh Fader oft tymes maketh great boste.
  That he his son to habundant riches shal auance
  But no thynge he speketh of vertuous gouernance.

  The feder made but smal shyft or prouysion.
  To induce his Son by vertuous doctryne.
  But whan he is dede and past: moche les shal the son
  To stody of grace his mynde or hert inclyne.
  But abuse his reason: and from al good declyne.
  Alas folysshe faders gyue your aduertence
  To Crates complaynt comprysed in this sentence.

  If it were graunted to me to shewe my thought
  Ye follysshe faders Caytifes I myght you cal
  Whiche gather riches to brynge your chylde to nought.
  Gyuynge him occasion forto be prodigal.
  But goode nor cunnynge shewe ye hym none at all.
  But whan ye drawe to age, ye than moste comonly.
  Sorowe for your suffrance. But without remedy.

  An olde sore to hele is oft halfe incurable
  Ryght so ar these Chyldren roted in myschefe
  Some after euer lyueth a lyfe abhomynable
  To all theyr Kyn great sorowe and reprefe.
  The one is a murderer the other a fereles thefe,
  The one of god nor goode man hath no fors ne care.
  Another so out wasteth that his frendes ar ful bare.

  Some theyr londe and lyuelode in riot out wasteth,
  At cardes, and, tenys, and other vnlawful gamys.
  And some wyth the Dyce theyr thryft away casteth.
  Some theyr soule damnes, and theyr body shames.
  With flesshly lust: which many one dyffamys.
  Spendynge the floures of youth moche vnthryftely.
  On dyuers Braunches that longe to Lechery.

  Another delyteth hymselfe in Glotony.
  Etynge and drynkynge without maner, or mesure:
  The more that some drynke: the more they wax drye.
  He is moste Galant whyche lengest can endure.
  Thus without mesure ouercharge they theyr nature.
  So that theyr Soule is loste theyr body and goode is spent.
  For lacke of doctryne, Norture and punysshment.

  Se here playne prose, example and euydence
  Howe youthe which is nat norysshed in doctryne.
  In age is gyuen vnto al Inconuenyence.
  But nought shall make youthe soner forto inclyne.
  To noble maners: nor Godly dysciplyne:
  Than shal the doctryne of a mayster wyse and sad:
  For the rote of vertue and wysdome therby is had.

  Without dout Noblenes is moche excellent
  Whiche oft causeth youth to be had in great honour.
  To haue the name, and lawde they ar content.
  Thoughe it be nat gotten by theyr owne labour.
  But what auayleth them this lewde obscure errour
  Of suche hye byrthe them self to magnyfy.
  Sythe they defyle it with vice and Uilany.

  Why art thou proude thou foul of that nobles
  Whyche is nat gotten by thyne owne vertue.
  By thy goode maners, wyt nor worthynes:
  But this forsothe oft tymes fynde I true
  That of a goode beste, yl whelpes may weshewe.
  In lyke wyse of a Moder that is bothe chast and goode.
  Often is brought forth a ful vngracious Brode.

  But though the childe be of lewde condicion
  And of his nature frowarde and varyable
  If the fader be slacke in the correccion
  Of his childe, he onely is culpable
  Whiche wyll nat teche hym maners commendable
  Thus is the fader a fole for his suffraunce
  And the sone also for his mysgouernaunce

  Of Achylles, and went forth in his steade
  Agaynst Hector: but lyghtly he was dede.

  But than Achylles seynge this myschaunce.
  Befallen his frende whiche was to hym so true.
  He hym addressyd shortly to take vengeaunce.

  In youth to stryue, but whan he came to age
  His naturall moder slewe he in a rage

  And also Egystus whiche had his fader slayne
  Thus toke he vengeaunce of both theyr cruelnes
  But yet it grewe to his great care and payne
  For sodaynly he fell in a madnesse
  And euer thought that in his furiousnes

  Orestes troubled with this fereful vysyon

  Ferynge no paynes of that dysordred place
  Nor obscure mystes or ayres odyous
  Tyll at the laste by his wayes cautelous

  Suffre not your soules damned and lost to be

  Of hell; and nowe in heuyn ar certayne
  What nede haue we to fere infernall payne.

  Than comys in an other with his dotysshe brayne

  Alleggynge our forefaders whiche haue mysdone
  Saynge that no synne is newe in our season

  That thus on hope do synne vnhappely
  Remember the synne of our forefaders done
  Haue neuer ben left vnpunysshed fynally
  And that somtyme, full sharpe and bytterly
  For euer more all synne hath had a fall

  The Pryde of rome, whiche was so excellent
  The offence of Dauyd Prophete and kynge royal
  The furour of Pharao fyers and violent
  Haue nat escaped the rightwyse punysshment
  Of God aboue, the celestial and highe Justice
  Which fyrst, or last punyssheth euery vyce.

  Remember Richarde lately kynge of price
  In Englonde raynynge vnrightwisely a whyle.
  Howe he ambycion, and gyleful Couetyse
  With innocent blode his handes dyd defyle
  But howbeit that fortune on hym dyd smyle
  Two yere or thre: yet god sende hym punysshment
  By his true seruant the rede Rose redolent.

  Therfore remember that god omnypotent
  Oft suffreth synners in theyr iniquyte
  Grauntynge them space and tyme of amendement
  And nat to procede in their enormyte
  But those synners that byde in one degre
  And in this lyfe their synne wyll nat refrayne
  God after punyssheth with infernall payne

  As I haue sayde (therfore) I say agayne
  Though god be of infynyte pety and mercy
  His fauour and grace passynge all synne mundayne
  Yet iustice is with hym eternally.

Whiche drynketh and deuoureth both day and nyght
Therin onely settynge all his felycyte

  Within our nauy he nedes shall haue a place.
  Whiche without mesure on lothsome glotony
  Setteth his pleasure and singuler solace
  His stomacke ouerchargynge, vyle and vngodely
  And to none other thynge his mynde doth he aply
  Saue depest to drynke, suche force nat of theyr soules
  But labore in rynsynge pecis cuppis and bowles

  The madnes of dronkennes is so immoderate
  That greuous sores it ingendreth and sykenes
  It causeth often great foly and debate
  With soden deth and carefull heuynes
  In thynges no difference putteth dronkennes.
  It febleth the ioyntis and the body within
  Wastynge the brayne makynge the wyt full thyn

  It engendreth in the hede infirmyte
  Blyndynge the herte wyt and discression
  The mynde it demynyssheth, coloure and beaute.
  Causynge all myschef, shame and abusyon
  It maketh men mad, and in conclusyon
  Causeth them lyue without lawe or measure
  Suynge after syn defylynge theyr nature

  The people that are acloyed with this synne.
  On no thynge els theyr myndes wyll aply:
  Saue to the wyne and ale stakes to renne
  And there as bestes to stryue and drynke auy
  Than ar they outher gyuyn to rybawdry
  Or els to brawle and fight at euery worde
  Thus dronkennes is the chefe cause of discorde

  But namely dronkennes and wretchyd glotony
  By their excesse and superfluyte
  Engendreth the rote of cursed Lechery
  With murder, thefte and great enormyte
  So bryngeth it many to great aduersyte
  And with his furour the worlde so doth it blynde
  That many it bryngeth to a shamfull ende

  This vyce (alas) good maners doth confounde
  And maketh man ouer besy of langage
  And hym that in all ryches doth abounde
  It ofte in pryson bryngeth and in bondage
  It causeth man to his great sorowe and domage
  Disclose his secrete and his preuey counsayle
  Whiche causeth hym after sore to mourne and wayle

  Nought is more lothsome, more vycyous nor vyle
  Than he that is subdued to this vyce

  Bereuynge his soule the ioy of Paradyse
  Howe many Cytees and lordes of great pryce
  Hath ben destroyed by dronken glotony
  And by his felawe, false loue, or lechery.

  The sone of Thomyr had nat ben ouercome

  With his swerde, whan he was dronken slewe
  Suche of his frendes as were to hym most trewe

  Upon a season played at the Chesse
  With one of his knyghtes which wan ynally
  Of hym great golde treasoure and rychesse
  And hym ouercame, but in a furyousnes
  And lade with wyne, this conquerour vp brayde
  And to his knyght in wrath these wordes sayde

  I haue subdued by strength and by wysdome
  All the hole worlde, whiche obeyeth to me
  And howe hast thou alone me thus ouercome
  And anone commaundyd his knyght hanged to be
  Than sayde the knyght by right and equyte
  I may apele. syns ye ar thus cruell
  Quod Alexander to whome wylt thou apell

  Knowest thou any that is gretter than I
  Thou shalt be hanged thou spekest treason playne
  The knyght sayd sauynge your honour certaynly
  I am no traytoure, apele I woll certayne
  From dronken Alexander tyll he be sober agayne
  His lorde than herynge his desyre sounde to reason
  Differryd the iustyce as for that tyme and season

  And than after whan this furour was gone
  His knyght he pardoned repentynge his blyndenes.
  And well consydered that he shulde haue mysdone
  If he to deth had hym done in that madnesse
  Thus it apereth what great unhappynes
  And blyndnes cometh to many a creature
  By wyne or ale taken without measure.

  Se here the inconuenyence manyfolde

  Some ar so starynge mad that none can them holde

  Some sowe dronke, swaloynge mete without mesure
  Some mawdelayne dronke, mournynge lowdly and hye
  Some beynge dronke no lenger can endure
  Without they gyue them to bawdy rybawdry
  Some swereth armys nayles herte and body.
  Terynge our lord worse, than the Jowes hym arayed
  Some nought can speke, but harkenyth what is sayd.

  Some spende all that they haue and more at wast
  With reuell and reuell dasshe fyll the cup Joohnn
  Some their thryft lesyth with dyce at one cast
  Some slepe as slogardes tyll their thryft be gone
  Some shewe theyr owne counsell for kepe can they none
  Some are Ape dronke full of lawghter and of toyes
  Some mery dronke syngynge with wynches and boyes

  Some spue, some stacker some vtterly ar lame
  Lyeng on the grounde without power to ryse
  Some bost them of bawdry ferynge of no shame
  Some dumme, and some speketh. ix. wordes at thryse
  Some charge theyr bely with wyne in suche wyse
  That theyr legges skant can bere vp the body

  Must lout and lurke, flater, lawde, and lye:
  And cloke a knauys counseyll, though it fals be

  If any do hym wronge or iniury
  He must it suffer and pacyently endure
  A dowble tunge with wordes lyke hony
  And of his offycis if he wyll be sure
  He must be sober and colde of his langage
  More to a knaue, than to one of hye lynage

  Oft must he stoupe his bonet in his honde
  His maysters backe he must oft shrape and clawe
  His breste anoyntynge, his mynde to vnderstonde
  But be it gode or bad therafter must he drawe
  Without he can Jest he is nat worth a strawe.
  But in the meane tyme beware that he none checke
  For than layth malyce a mylstone in his necke

  He that in court wyll loue and fauour haue
  A fole must hym fayne, if he were none afore
  And be as felowe to euery boy and knaue
  And to please his lorde he must styll laboure sore
  His manyfolde charge maketh hym coueyt more

  Examples hereof thou canst nat lacke nor want
  The great Medas somtyme kynge tryumphant.
  Of Phrygye By his owne folysshe desyre
  With paynfull hunger, his lyfe breth dyd expyre

  This kynge Mydas of whom I haue you tolde
  Of god desyred with prayer dylygent.
  That all that he touchyd tourne myght vnto golde
  His prayer was harde, he obteynyd his intent
  But nat to his welth, but mortall punysshement
  For whan he brede or drynke tast or touche sholde
  Incontynent was it tourned in to golde

  Thus was his prayer to his owne damage
  For at the laste he dyed in wo and payne
  For no golde coude his sore hunger asswage
  Nor his desyre coude he nat call agayne.
  Thus his peticion desyred was in vayne:
  And where he wenyd great welth to get therby
  He dyed in shame hunger and mysery.

  Some dayly pray with marueylous besynes
  Cryeng and syghynge to god omnypotent
  For to haue plenty of welth ioy and ryches
  And to be made ryche myghty and excellent.
  O cursyd lyuers, o blynde men of intent
  On suche desyres they set theyr mynde and thought
  Whiche thousandes vnto shamefull ende hath brought

  What profyted the myghty edefyces:

  Peleus, and Nestor and many other mo
  As Itackes and laertes, sore haue complayned
  For to longe age, euer full of payne and wo
  Wherwith theyr bodyes sore haue ben constrayned
  And with great sorowes and dyuers often payned:
  And to conclude brefly in one sentence

  For this is dayly sene, and euer shall
  That he that coueytys hye to clym aloft
  If he hap to fall, his fall can nat be soft

  Some other pray for bewty and fayrnes
  And that to a cursyd purpose and intent
  Wherby they lese the heuenly blyssydnes:
  Theyr soule subduynge to infernall turment
  O ye mad folys of myndes ympotent
  Pray your Pater noster with deuoute herte and mynde
  For therin is all that is nedefull to mankynde

  Our sauyour criste whyle he was on this grounde

  Taught his disciples this prayer whiche doth sounde
  Nere to this sentence, nor greatly doth nat vary
  (Our father wiche art in heuen) eternally
  Thy name be halowyd (graunt that to thy kyngdome)

  Whan thou hast clensyd thy mynde from syn before

  Nowe in this Nauy many them selfe present
  Of this our roylame and from beyond the see
  Whiche in theyr stody or lewde and neglygent
  Lesynge theyr tyme at the vnyuersyte
  Yet count they them selfe of great auctoryte
  With theyr proude hodes on theyr neckes hangynge
  They haue the lawde: but other haue the cunnynge

  They thynke that they haue all scyence perfytely
  Within theyr hertes bostynge them of the same
  Though they therto theyr mynde dyd neuer aply
  Without the thynge, they ioy them of the name
  But suche mad folys to theyr great losse and shame
  Whyle they sholde norysshe theyr myndes with science
  They seke theyr pleasour, gyuen to neglygence

  They wander in euery inconuenyence
  From strete to strete, from tauerne to tauerne
  But namely youth, foloweth all offence
  No thynge intendynge the profyte to dyscerne
  Nor fruyte of cunnynge wherby they myght gouerne
  Them selfe by reason, but suche thynges they ensue
  Wherby they neyther get good maners nor vertne

  But he that intendeth to come to the science
  And godly wysdome of our elders: certayne.
  He must sore stody, for without dilygence
  And besy laboure no man can it obtayne
  None ought to cesse: though it firste be a payne.
  In good perseueraunce getteth great ryches
  Where no good cometh by sleuthfull ydelnes.

  But moste I marueyll of other folys blynde
  Whiche in dyuers scyencis ar fast laborynge
  Both daye and nyght with all theyr herte and mynde
  But of gramer knowe they lytyll or no thynge
  Whiche is the grounde of all lyberall cunnynge
  Yet many ar besy in Logyke and in lawe
  Whan all theyr gramer is skarsly worth a strawe

  If he haue onys red the olde dotrinall
  With his diffuse and vnparfyte breuyte
  He thynketh to haue sene the poyntis of grammer all.
  And yet of one errour he maketh two or thre
  Precyan or sulpice disdayneth he to se
  Thus many whiche say that they theyr grammer can
  Ar als great folys as whan they firste began

  One with his speche rounde tournynge lyke a whyle
  Of logyke the knottis doth lows and vndo
  In hande with his sylogysimes, and yet doth he fele
  No thynge what it menyth, nor what longeth therto
  Nowe sortes currit: Nowe is in hande plato
  Another comyth in with bocardo and pheryson
  And out goeth agayne a fole in conclusyon

  There is nought else but Est and non est
  Blaberynge and chydynge, as it were beawlys wyse
  They argue nought els but to proue man a beest
  Homo est Asinus is cause of moche stryfe
  Thus passe forth these folys the dayes of theyr lyfe
  In two syllabis, not gyuynge aduertence
  To other cunnynge doctryne, nor scyence.

  I wyll nat say but that it is expedyent
  The to knowe of Logyke the chrafte and connynge
  For by argument it maketh euydent
  Moche obscurenes, somtyme enlumynynge
  The mynde: and sharpynge the wyt in many a thynge
  But oft yet by it a thynge playne bryght and pure
  Is made diffuse, vnknowen harde and obscure

  It is ynoughe therof to knowe the grounde
  And nat therin to wast all thy lyfe holly
  Styll grutchynge lyke vnto the frogges sounde
  Or lyke the chaterynge of the folysshe pye

  With suche folyes tender youth is defylyd
  And all theyr dayes on them they set delyte
  But godly doctryne is from theyr myndes exylyd
  Whiche sholde the body and soule also profyte
  They take no layser, pleasur nor respyte
  To other scyences, pleasaunt and profytable
  But without ende in one thynge chat and bable

  One rennyth to almayne another vnto fraunce
  To parys padway Lumbardy or spayne
  Another to Bonony, Rome or orleance
  To cayne, to Tolows, Athenys or Colayne
  And at the last retournyth home agayne

  Thus muste a gode clerke vnto a foule enclyne
  Lowt with the body and with obedyence becke
  And thoughe it tourne to theyr rebuke and checke
  Yet nowe a dayes ouer many suche there be.

  Before his presence parfytely seynge
  All thynge to come that neuer hath had beynge
  His workes and dedys ar so perfyte and ryght
  That none can increas nor yet decreas his myght

  And namely suche that lowest ar in degre
  Of byrth and cunnynge, of this condycion be
  Defylynge goddes rentis and the chirches goode
  Them selfe ouer ladynge, as men frantyke and wode

  The weght is so great they can it nat endure
  Theyr myght is small, theyr cunnynge is moche lesse
  Thus this great charge wherof they haue the cure
  To infernall Fenn doth this pore Asse oppresse
  And to an Asse moste lyke he is doutles
  Whiche takynge on his backe sackes nyne or tenne.
  Destroyeth hymselfe them leuynge in the fenne

  But though one prebende were to hym suffycient
  Or one benefyce his lyuynge myght suffyse
  Yet this blynde fole is nat therwith content
  But labowreth for mo, and alway doth deuyse
  Fals meanes to come therto by couetyse
  He gapeth with his wyde throte insaciable
  And neuer can content his wyll abhomynable

  So for the loue of the peny and ryches.
  He taketh this charge to lyue in welth and eas.
  Howe be it that sole that hath suche besynes
  And dyueres charges fyndeth great disseas
  Neyther shall he god, nor yet the worlde pleas
  And shall with his burthyns his mynde so vex and comber
  That halfe his cures, can he nat count nor nomber

  These carefull caytyfs, that ar of this same sort
  With cures ar ouerchargyd so that of theyr mynde.
  Rest haue they none, solace, pleasour nor conforte
  Howe be it they thynke therby great welth to fynde
  They gape yet euer, theyr maners lyke the wynde
  Theyr lyfe without all terme or sertaynte
  If they haue two lyuynges, yet loke they to haue thre

  The folys whose hertis vnto this vyce ar bounde
  Upon theyr sholders bereth aboute a sacke.
  Insaciable without botome, outher grounde:
  They thynke them nat lade though all be on theyr backe.
  The more that they haue (the more they thynke they lacke)
  What deuyll can stop theyr throte so large and wyde
  Yet many all waste aboute Ryot and pryde

  But yet is this moche more abhomynable
  That asses vntaught without wysdome or scyence
  Haue theyr proude myndes moste vnsaciable
  Nat commynge to worshyp by vertue nor prudence
  Yet counte they them worthy of this excellence
  Courters become prestis nought knowynge but the dyce
  They preste not for god, but for a benefyce

  The clerke of the kechyn is a prest become
  In full trust to come to promosyon hye
  No thynge by vertue cunnynge nor wysdome
  But by couetyse, practyse and flatery
  The Stepyll and the chirche by this meane stand awry
  For some become rather prestis for couetyse.
  Than for the loue of god or his seruyce.

  Alas oft goddes goodes and cristis herytage
  Of suche folys is wastyd and spent in vayne
  In great folyes mundaynes and outrage
  Where it decreed, and ordeyned is certayne.
  That prestis sholde helpe pore people that lyue in payne
  And with suche goodes kepe hospytalyte
  Whiche pryde ryot and Uenus suffreth nat to be

  Thus is the grettest parte of the spiritualte
  Pore preste, persone, vicayr, relygyon and prelate
  With couetyse acloyde outher prodigalyte
  And folys promotyd causyth good clerkis haue hate
  Say lordes and bysshops with other of estate
  What mouyth you so gladly, suche to promote
  Whiche haue no cunnynge their wyt skant worth a grote

  Wyll ye alway the folysshe asse ouercharge
  With suche burthyns wherwith it can nat fare
  And suffer other to walke and ren at large
  And where they best myght bere theyr backes ar left bare
  And that is worst of all, suche folys can nat be ware
  But whan they ar promotyd after theyr owne entent.
  Yet theyr insaciable mynde can neuer be content.

  Some make exchanges and permutacions
  Some take to ferme, and some let out agayne
  Other folys for hope make resignacions
  And some for one god scosyth gladly twayne
  Some lyueth longe in hunger and in payne
  And in the somer day skarsly drynketh twyse
  Sparynge monay therwith to by a benefyce

  Some for no wages in court doth attende
  With lorde or knyght, and all for this polecy
  To get of his lorde a benefyce at the ende
  And in the meane tyme ensueth rybawdry
  And somtyme laboureth by chraft of symony.
  He playeth a fals cast, nat cessynge to coniure
  Tyll of some benefyce he at the last be sure

  Than if this lorde haue in hym fauoure, he hath hope
  To haue another benefyce of gretter dignyte
  And so maketh a fals suggestyon to the pope
  For a Tot quot outher els a pluralyte
  Than shall he nat be pleased with .II. nouther thre
  But dyuers wyll he haue ay choppynge and changynge
  So oft a fole all and a gode clerke no thynge

  These of nought force so that they may haue gayne
  And golde ynough to spende on rybawdry and pryde
  They haue the profyte, another hath the payne
  The cure of the soulys of them is set asyde
  And no meruayle, for howe sholde they abyde.
  To teche their parysshynges vertue wysdome or grace
  Syns no man can be atonys in euery place

  Alas these folys our mayster criste betray
  Of mannes soule wherof they haue the cure
  And settynge in their stede syr Johnn of garnesey
  They thynketh them selfe dischargyd quyte and sure
  These folys note nat that euery creature.
  Whiche here of soulys doth cure or charge take
  At domys day a compt for them shall make

  But if I sholde touche all the enormytees
  The immoderat couetyse and desyre of dignyte
  That nowe is vsed amonge all the degrees
  Of benefycyd men ouer all the spiritualte
  I fere displeasour, and also I often se

And feryth of hir lyuynge by his Jelowse intent
Is as great fole, as is that wytles wratche
That wolde kepe flees vnder the son feruent
Or in the se cast water, thynkynge it to augment
For thoughe he hir watche lockynge with lockys twayne

  If she be nought there is no remedy.

  Thy labour lost is, thou takest this care in vayne
  In vayne thou takest this Jelowsy and thought
  In vayne thou sleest thy selfe with care and payne
  And of one doute thou fole thou makest twayne
  And neuer shalt fynde eas nor mery lyuynge

  For locke hir fast and all hir lokes marke.
  Note all hir steppys, and twynklynge of hir iye.
  Ordeyne thy watchers and dogges for to barke
  Bar fast thy dores and yet it wyll nat be
  Close hir in a Toure with wallys stronge and hye
  But yet thou fole thou lesist thy trauayle

  She shall disceyue the (If she lyst) without fayle

  Hir selfe shall she kepe, though thou hir neuer bynde
  Thus they that ar chast of nature, wyll byde so
  And nought wyll be nought what so euer thou do

  Bytwene man and wyfe, whan he by Jelowsy.
  His wyfe suspectyth, and doth watche or counterwayt
  Or hir mysdemyth and kepyth in stratly.
  Wherfore me thynke it is best remedy
  For hym that gladly wolde escape the hode
  Nat to be Jelous: but honest lyuynge and gode

  Coude nat the damsell (by name Danes) defende
  But that Jupiter fonde a cautell and trayne
  In a golden shoure into hir to discende
  And to be short, at conclusyon and ende
  This mayde for all this Toure was there defylyd.
  And by this lorde was she there brought with childe

  By this example it apereth euydent
  That it is foly a woman to kepe or close
  For if she be of lewde mynde or intent
  Outher preuy or apert there about she goys
  Deuysynge wayes with hir good man to glose

  With a hode shall he vnwars be ouerdect

  The fere of payne and lawe is set a syde
  Faythe is clene lost, and fewe them selfe do gyde

  But dye they must, and from this wolde go
  All worldly thynges whiche god hath here create
  Shall nat ay byde, but haue an ende also

  In worldly welthe or vncertayne dignyte
  That euer of lyfe had houre of certaynte

  In stormy wyndes lowest trees ar most sure
  And howsys surest whiche ar nat byldyd hye
  Where as hye byldynges may no tempest endure

  If that mysfortune constrayne hym to dyscende

  With loueles fere, and fayned countenaunce

Of them that se others aduersyte
Theyr wofull fall the ruyne and dystres.
Yet sue they the same, and ware they wyll nat be
Though they by example the payne of other se
Yet leue they nat: thus may they clayme a place
Within my Nauy, as folys voyde of grace]

  We dayly se the mysfortune and damage
  And often fallys, to pouerte and payne
  Whiche folys suffer for theyr synne and outrage
  Some drowned, some maymed, some other wyse slayne
  Yet this example can nat cause vs refrayne
  Our wretchyd lyfe, and seke for remedy
  We marke no thynge anothers ieopardy.

  We se the mockynge scorne and derysyon
  That folys hath ofte tyme whan they offende
  We se theyr losse, theyr shame and theyr confusion
  Howe be it all this can cause vs to amende
  We can no thynge and to nought we intende
  So many folys I fynde that playne I thynke
  Theyr weyghty charge shall cause my shyp to synke

  Suche ar despysyd of men discrete and wyse
  Ye and more ouer these folys ar so blynde
  That echone of them the other doth despyse
  With sharp rebukes, wordes lewde and vnkynde
  Yet in theyr lyfe no difference may we fynde
  And though they haue sene a thousande brough to shame
  For one sore vyce: yet lyue they in the same

  The example of other can nat theyr myndes moue
  Theyr wyttis ar blynde theyr foly is the cause
  Alas mad folys why do ye vyce thus loue
  Rennynge ay to deth without all rest or pause
  Alas, at the last retourne to christis lawes
  Be ware, whan ye other se taken in the snare
  Let anothers peryll cause you to be ware

  Ye do nat so, alas it is great shame
  Your synne hath quenchyd your grace and gostly lyght
  One blynde man another doth chyde and blame
  And yet both stomble, nat goynge euyn or right
  A blynde man hym ledyth that also hath no syght
  So both in the dyche fallyth in suche a wyse
  That one can nat helpe, the other agayne to ryse

  One crab blamys another for hir bacwarde pace
  And yet the blamer sothly can none other do
  But both two ar in theyr goynge in lyke case
  The one goeth bocwarde, the other doth also
  Many of these folys after that maner go
  But who that of his moders doctryne hath disdayne:
  Shall by his stepdame endure wo care and payne

  And perchaunce after abyde the correccyon
  Of the sayde stepdame, in place of punysshement.
  For his synne, sufferynge hir vniust subieccien
  And who that nat foloweth the commaundement
  Of his fader beynge to hym obedyent
  May fortune after in hunger thyrst ond colde
  Obey that stranger, whom he nat gladly wolde

  We fynde Hystories wryten longe and ample
  In dyuers bokes of great auctoryte
  The hole Bybyll sheweth to vs example
  Howe they were punysshed that lyuyd in cruelte
  I fynde also wryten in bokes of Poetrye
  Howe that Pheton was brent with the lyghtnynge
  For his presumpcion, agaynst a myghty kynge

  We haue example also by Icarus
  Whiche contrary vnto the commaundement
  Of his crafty father named Dedalus
  By fleynge to hye his wynges and fethers brent
  And so descendyd and in the se was drent
  Thus these two endynge by theyr lewdnes in care
  By theyr example sholde cause vs to beware

  We dayly se before our syght and our presence
  What mysauenture to many one doth fall
  And that worthely for theyr synne and offence
  Yet ar we blynde, and ar nat ware at all
  But in our synnes lyue vnto them egall
  And where by synne we se one come to shame
  We wyllyngly (alas) ensue the same

  Therfore who sethe a mad fole come to wo
  Or fall in peryll for lacke of a good gyde
  By another way ought craftely to go
  And (by anothers yll) for his helthe to prouyde
  The fox was ware, and peryll set asyde
  And wolde nat enter into the caue, for playne
  Of bestis that entred sawe he none come agayne

Can nat greatly hurt them that lyue rightwysly
Wherfore it is foly theyr babblynge to set by.]

  Who that within this worlde wolde rest and lyue
  In eas of mynde, peas and tranquyllyte
  Must nat his mynde set, nor his erys gyue
  To the vayne talys, of the rude comonte
  And though some people of suche condicion be
  Oft to dyffame good people true and Just
  Let them nought care, for byde it nede they must

  Let no man care for the lewde hyssynges
  And yll soundynges of this vnhappy rage

  Must suffer suche trouble as belongeth therto

  Yet some haue pytched theyr tentis stedfastly
  Upon sure grounde, auoyde of all this payne
  Despysynge the worldes wantonnes and foly
  For in the same is nought sure nor certayne
  Nought se we tranquyll in these wawes mundayne
  We se no loue, lawe, fydelyte, nor trust
  But nowe up hye, and nowe lowe in the dust

  To auoyde the worlde with his foly and stryfe
  Many hath left londes townes and ryches
  And yll company lyuynge solytary lyfe
  Alone in desert and in wyldernes
  Ye and that: men of moste wyt and worthynes
  Whiche by that meane dyd best of all eschewe

  He that intendeth to lyue a rightwyse lyfe
  And so procedeth in maners and good dede
  Of worldly sclaunder, complaynt, hatered, and stryfe
  And all yll wyll, he ought nat to take hede
  For he that is iuste ought no thynge for to drede
  A sclaundrynge tonge, ye, be it neuer so wode
  For suche lewde tonges can none hurte that ar gode.

  Lyue well and wysely, than let men chat theyr fyll
  Wordes ar but wynde, and though it oft so fall
  That of lewde wordes comyth great hurte and yll
  Yet byde the ende, that onely prouyth all
  If thou canst suffer truste well that thou shall
  Ouercome thyne ennemyes better by pacience

  They sholde nat haue durst the peoples vyce to blame
  So sholde they haue lost their honour and good name
  Theyr fame and meryt, but nowe they haue nat so
  But spred theyr fame, whiche neuer away shall go

  Forsoth none lyueth within the worlde wyde

  Whiche can hym selfe at euery tyme so gyde

  Forsoth he myght be named excellent

  Whiche euery man cowde serue content and pleas

  But suche is none, and he that wyll assay
  For to content eche folysshe mannes mynde
  Must brake his slepe and stody nyght and day
  And yet alway some fole shall be behynde
  Ye if one lyue well, yet wyll they somwhat fynde

  For beggers and bawdes therin haue all theyr game

  For whether thou dwell in Est west north or south
  Of suche dryuels euer shalt thou fynde plente
  One must haue moche mele, to stoppe eche mannys mouth
  Sclander is the cunnynge of all the comonte
  And in the same suche ay moste besy be
  Whiche lyue them selfe in shame and vylany
  Euen nowe they speke repentynge by and by

  Thus all the cunnynge and stody dilygent.
  Of people vnthryfty is alway to despyse
  And diffame other whiche ar but innocent
  Wherfore let suche as ar discrete and wyse

THE ENUOY OF BARKLAY TO THE FOLYS.

  Trouble nat thy selfe (thou man) where is no nede
  And arme thou thy selfe with goodly pacyence
  Be sure it is great foly to take hede
  Unto backbytynge syns that no resystence
  May be founde to withstande his violence
  And take thou this one thynge for thy comfort
  That none wyse, or good, wyll commyt this offence
  But all ar caytyffes, that ar of this lewde sort.

       *       *       *       *       *


Of mockers, and scorners, and
false accusers.

[Illustration: Yet ar mo Folys whiche mocke and scorneth fast
Suche as them shewyth wysdome and doctryne
And at theyr hedes (vngoodly) stonys cast
In mynde disdaynynge to wysdome to enclyne
But gladly they ensue the discyplyne
Of folysshe mockers, let wyse men them eschewe
For no correccion can brynge them to vertue]

  O Hertles folys, haste here to our doctryne
  Leue of the wayes of your enormyte
  Enforce you to my preceptis to enclyne
  For here shall I shewe you good and veryte
  Enclyne, and ye fynde shall great prosperyte
  Ensuynge the doctryne of our faders olde
  And godly lawes in valour worth great golde

  Who that wyll folowe the graces manyfolde
  Whiche ar in vertue, shall fynde auauncement
  Wherfore ye folys that in your syn ar bolde
  Ensue ye wysedome and leue your lewde intent
  Wysdome is the way of men most excellent
  Therfore haue done, and shortly spede your pace
  To quaynt your selfe and company with grace.

  Lerne what is vertue, therin is great solace
  Lerne what is trouth sadnes and prudence
  Let grutche be gone, and grauyte purchace
  Forsake your foly and inconuenyence
  Cesse to be folys, and ay to sue offence
  Folowe ye vertue, chefe rote of godlynes
  For it and wysdome is grounde of clenlynes

  Wysedome and vertue two thynges ar doutles
  Whiche man endueth with honour specyall
  But suche hertis as slepe in folysshnes
  Knoweth no thynge, and wyll nought knowe at all
  But in this lytell barge in pryncypall
  All folysshe mockers I purpos to repreue
  Clawe he his backe that felyth ytche or greue

  Mockers and scorners that ar harde of byleue
  With a rugh combe here wyll I clawe and grate
  To proue if they wyll from theyr vyce remeue
  And leue theyr foly whiche causeth great debate
  Suche caytyfs spare neyther pore man nor estate
  And where theyr selfe ar moste worthy of dyrysion
  Other men to scorne is all theyr moste condicion

  Yet ar mo folys of this abusion
  Whiche of wyse men despyseth the doctryne
  With mowes, mockes, scorne, and collusyon
  Rewardynge rebukes, for theyr good disciplyne
  Shewe to suche wysdome, yet shall they nat enclyne
  Unto the same, but set no thynge therby
  But mocke thy doctryne, styll or openly

  So in the worlde it apereth comonly
  That who that wyll a Fole rebuke or blame
  A mocke or mowe shall he haue by and by
  Thus in derysyon, haue folys theyr speciall game
  Correct a wyse man, that wolde eschewe yll name
  And fayne wolde lerne, and his lewde lyfe amende
  And to thy wordes he gladly shall intende

  If by mysfortune a rightwyse man offende
  He gladly suffreth a iuste correccion
  And hym that hym techyth taketh for his frende
  Hym selfe puttynge mekely vnto subieccion
  Folowynge his preceptis and good dyreccion
  But if that one a Fole rebuke or blame
  He shall his techer, hate, sclaunder, and dyffame

  Howbeit his wordes, oft turne to his owne shame
  And his owne dartis retourne to hym agayne
  And so is he sore woundyd with the same
  And in wo endyth, great mysery and payne
  It also prouyd full often is certayne
  That they that on mockes alway theyr myndes cast
  Shall of all other be mocked at the last

  He that goeth right, stedfast sure and fast
  May hym well mocke that goth haltynge and lame
  And he that is whyte may well his scornes cast
  Agaynst a man of ynde, but no man ought to blame
  Anothers vyce whyle he vsyth the same
  But who that of synne is clene in dede and thought
  May hym well scorne whose lyuynge is starke nought

  The scornes of Naball full dere sholde haue ben bought
  If Abigayll his wyfe discrete and sage
  Had nat by kyndnes right crafty meanes sought
  The wrath of Dauyd to temper and asswage
  Hath nat two berys in theyr fury and rage
  Two and fourty Children rent and torne
  For they the Prophete Helyseus dyd scorne

  So myght they curse the tyme that they were borne
  For theyr mockynge of this Prophete dyuyne
  So many other of this sorte often mowrne
  For theyr lewde mockes, and fall in to ruyne
  Thus is it foly for wyse men to enclyne

  Take ye example by Cham the son of Noy
  Whiche laughyd his Father vnto derysyon
  Whiche hym, after, cursyd for his transgressyon
  And made hym seruaunt to all his lyne and stocke
  So shall ye Caytyfs at the conclusyon

The heuen and erth to knowe the heuyest
And by his foly and cursed ignoraunce

And thoughe that here be neyther ioy nor rest
Yet had some leuer here styll to remayne
Than to depart to heuen voyde of al payne]

  My hande is wery: fayne wolde I rest a space

  O sleuthfull fole say why doste nat thou call
  Unto thy mynde that this worldes wretchydnes

  Why settest thou so moche by frayle delyciousnes
  On vayne pleasours, whiche shall sothly decay

  I say that pleasours and also ioyes mundayne
  As it apereth playne by good euydence
  Ar fylled with sorowe bytternes and payne
  Without all rest quyete or certayne
  And yet alas the worlde so doth men blynde
  That it they loue and caste heuen out of mynde

  Wherfore it hapneth full often as I fynde
  That suche as foloweth shamefull wantonnes
  Ungoodly luste, and statelynes of mynde
  Shall ofte perceyue great shame and wretchydnes
  And them most suffer, with great mundayne distres.
  And better charges, and after must nede endure
  Cruell deth whiche ende is of euery creature

  The worlde shall passe: ye and all ioy mundayne

  From dethes dartis. and for conclusyon.
  We dayly se many mennys confusyon.

  We dayly se the fallys innumerable
  And greuous deth aswell of youth as age
  Thus is this wretchyd worlde moche vnstable
  Wherfore me thynke it is a great outrage
  To trust therto, or for an vnsure stage

  So with suche folys is neyther peas nor rest

  He is a fole his herte or mynde to set

  Oft man deuydeth away from heuenly helth

  Thus he that prayeth for welth or for ryches
  Or in this worlde hym selfe to magnyfy
  Prayeth for his hurt and cause of viciousnes
  For worldly welth doth vyce oft multyply
  So seke men theyr owne peryll wyllyngly

  He bloweth in the wynde, and shall nat haue his thought

  And who that to honour couetyse to ascende

  Thou man that hast thy secret in thy brest
  Holde it styll there suffer it nat out to go
  Who that so doth, therby shall fynde great rest
  Ne to thy frende shewe nat thy mynde also
  For if that he after become thy fo

  So sholde thy foly tourne vnto thy great wo
  Howe be it suche thynges are prouyd comonly.

Of yonge folys that take olde wymen to
theyr wyues, for theyr ryches.

[Illustration: Within our shyp that fole shall haue a hode
Whiche an olde wyfe taketh in maryage
Rather for hir ryches and hir worldly gode
Than for pure loue, or hope to haue lynage
But suche youth as mary them selfe with age
The profyte and pleasour of wedlocke lese certayne
And worthely lyue in brawlynge stryfe and payne.]

  Under the Asse tayle thoughe it be no thynge pure
  Yet many seke and grope for the vyle fatnes
  Gatherynge togyther the fowle dunge and ordure
  Suche ar they that for treasour and ryches
  Whyle they ar yonge in theyr chefe lustynes
  An agyd woman taketh to theyr wyfe
  Lesynge theyr youth, and shortynge so theyr lyfe

  They that so do hath neyther rest nor peas
  But besy brawlynge and stryfe contynuall
  They have no pleasour, but thought and great dyseas
  Rebuke out braydynge, and strypes whan they fall
  But theyr owne foly is grounde and cause of all
  For they be maryd unto the vyle treasour
  And precious bagges, but nat for godly pleasour

  They haue no hope of children nor lynage
  Loue is there none, and durynge theyr wretchyd lyfe
  Is nat one day in suche mad maryage
  Auoyde of brawlynge, of hatered and of stryfe
  But that pore man that weddeth a ryche wyfe
  Cast in his nose shall styll hir bagges fynde
  For whose cause he made was made and blynde

  They that ar weddyd nat for loue but rychesse
  Of moryage despysynge the pleasour and profyte
  Suche seldome sauour fortunes happynes
  But oft mysfortune them greuously doth byte
  Thus gone is theyr pleasour theyr ioy and delyte
  And for vayne treasoure suche ar so glad and fayne
  That for the same they them subdue to payne

  They wyllyngly to payne them selfe subdue
  The whiche ar weddyd for wretchyd couetyse
  They take no hede to maners and vertue
  To honeste nor wysdome but lyue ay in malyce
  For if a woman be fowle and full of vice
  And lewde of maners, nought both to man and lad
  Yet good shall hir mary be she neuer so bad

  If that a man of hye or lowe degre
  Wolde spouse his doughter vnto a strange man
  He nought inquyreth of his honestye
  Of his behauour, nor if he norture can
  But if he be ryche in londes and good: than
  He shall be prayed his doughter for to haue
  Thoughe be but a bonde man or a knaue

  The firste enquyrynge and speciall questyon
  Is of the money, that thynge namely they moue
  And last of all aske they the condicion
  So whan they mete they neuer haue perfyte loue
  Wherfore it were better to suche for theyr behoue
  To byde alone in deserte and wyldernes
  Than in wedloke in payne for frayle ryches

  Forsoth it is an vnmete maryage
  And disagreynge and moche agaynst the lawe
  Bytwene fresshe youth, and lame vnlusty age
  The loue bytwene them is scantly worth a strawe
  So doth the one styll on the other gnawe
  And oft the man in mynde doth sore complayne.
  His sede to sowe vpon a grounde barayne

  Than muste he haue another prymme or twayne
  With them to slake his wanton yonge cowrage
  But in that space must he endure great payne
  With hir that he hath tane in maryage
  Hir bablynge tunge whiche no man can asswage
  With wrathfull wordes shall sle hym at the laste
  His other prymes his good shall spende and waste

  Thus who that selleth his youthes lustynes
  For frayle ryches and this mundayne vanyte
  He byeth stryfe, gyle and falshode endlesse
  Suche force nat for fayth true loue nor honestye
  And thoughe that he discende of hye degre
  For hope of money he shall an olde fole wed
  By whose foly he to euery yll is led.

  And so these folys subdue them to bondage
  And worthely endure suche payne and punysshement
  They hope therby to come to auantage
  But that they lese and lyue in sore tourment
  They wast theyr good, and so whan that is spent
  And nought remayneth theyr bodyes to relefe
  Theyr disputacion is nought but hore and thefe

  But if I sholde wryte all the vnhappynes
  The wrath discorde and the great deuysyon
  Wherin they lyue, that mary for ryches
  And nat for loue. I neuer sholde haue done
  Wherfore this say I for a conclusyon
  That he shall neuer thryue ne come to his behoue
  That weddyth a wyfe for gode and nat for loue

THE ENUOY OF BARKLAY.

  Alas man myndles what is thyne intent
  To wed for ryches, that weddynge I defy
  Maryage was ordeyned by god omnypotent
  In goddes lawes the worlde to multyply
  Wherfore that man that wyll therto aply
  And wolde haue the profyte of faythfull maryage
  This worldly ryches ought no thynge to set by
  But wed for loue and hope to haue lynage

  Remember ryches is no thynge comparable
  To mekenes vertue and discrete gouernaunce
  And other maners whiche ar more commendable
  Than worldly treasour or suche vnsure substaunce
  Wherfore consyder and call to thy remembraunce
  That better is to haue some woman pore and bare
  And lyue in eas: Than one with habundaunce

THE ENOUY OF BARKLAY TO THE FOLYS.

  O man that hast thy trust and confydence
  Fyxed on these frayle fantasyes mundayne
  Remember at the ende there is no difference
  Bytwene that man that lyued hath in payne
  And hym that hath in welth and ioy souerayne
  They both must dye their payne is of one sort
  Both ryche and pore, no man can deth refrayne
  For dethes dart expellyth all confort

  Say where is Adam the fyrst progenytour
  Of all mankynde is he nat dede and gone
  And where is Abell of innocence the flour
  With adamys other sonnes euerychone
  A: dredfull deth of them hath left nat one
  Where is Mathusalem, and Tuball that was playne
  The first that played on Harpe or on Orgone
  _Ilz sont tous mortz ce monde est choce vayne_

  Where is iust Noy and his ofsprynge become
  Where is Abraham and all his progeny
  As Isaac and Jacob, no strength nor wysdome
  Coude them ensure to lyue contynually
  Where is kynge Dauyd whome god dyd magnyfy
  And Salomon his son of wysdome souerayne
  Where ar his sonnes of wysdome and beauty
  _Ilz sont toutz mortz ce monde est choce vayne._

  Where ar the prynces and kynges of Babylon
  And also of Jude and kynges of Israell
  Where is the myghty and valiant Sampson
  He had no place in this lyfe ay to dwell
  Where ar the Prynces myghty and cruell
  That rayned before Christ delyuered vs from payne
  And from the Dongeons of darke and ferefull hell
  _Ilz sont toutz mortz ce monde est choce vayne._

  Of worldly worsyp no man can hym assure
  In this our age whiche is the last of all
  No creature can here alway endure
  Yonge nor olde, pore man nor kynge royall
  Unstable fortune tourneth as doth a ball
  And they that ones pas can nat retourne agayne
  Wherfore I boldly dare speke in generall
  We all shall dye: _ce monde est choce vayne_.

  Ryches nor wysdome can none therfro defende
  Ne in his strength no man can hym assure
  Say where is Tully is he nat come to ende
  Seneke the sage with Cato and Arture
  The hye Arystotyll of godly wyt and pure
  The glorious Godfray, and myghty Charlemayne
  Thoughe of theyr lyfe they thought that they were sure
  Yet ar they all dede: _ce monde est choce vayne_.

  Where ar the Phylosophers and Poetis lawreat
  The great Grammaryens and pleasant oratours.
  Ar they nat dede after the same fourme and rate
  As ar all these other myghty conquerours
  Where ar theyr Royalmes theyr ryches and treasours
  Left to theyr heyres: and they be gone certayne
  And here haue left theyr riches and honours
  So haue they proued that this worlde is but vayne.

  So I conclude bycause of breuyte
  That if one sought the worlde large and wyde
  Therin sholde be founde no maner of dere
  That can alway in one case suerly byde
  Strength, honour, riches cunnynge and beautye
  All these decay, dayly: thoughe we complayne
  _Omnia fert etas_, both helth and iolyte
  We all shall dye: _ce monde est choce vayne_.

  Of many folys this is the moste musynge
  Whiche labour dayly with besy cure and payne.
  To knowe what god doth discerne and or ordayne

  Therfore in this part I shall dispyse and blame
  Unchrafty folys whiche scantly haue ouer sene
  Ought of scripture, if they knowe the bokes name
  Or els a whyle hath at the Scoles bene
  Than bende they the browys and stedfastly they wene

  For all scripture newe commentis to deuyse

  And that whiche is wryten, both playne and holely
  By theyr corruptynge and vnlawfull glose
  Oft tyme they brynge to damnable heresy
  Falsly expoundynge after theyr fantasy
  They labour to transpose and turne the right sence
  Thoughe the wordes stryue and make great resystence

  Here what these folys with theyr audacyte
  Dare besely say by theyr fals errour blynde
  Presumynge on goddes secrete and pryuete
  Here what lewde wordes they cast out in the wynde
  They say what man can chaunge or turne his mynde
  To lyue after any other fourme and rate
  But lyke as he is therto predestynate

  They say: if god that rayneth ouerall
  Hath any ordeyned that in this worlde is
  To come to the place and rowme celestyall
  For to be partyner of euerlastynge blys
  Ordeyned for suche as here doth nat amys
  No man can chaunge, not other thynge mundayne
  That thynge whiche god by his myght doth ordayne

  But if that god prefyxed hath before
  Any creature vnto infernall payne
  In derknes to be damnyd for euer more
  No erthly thynge may that sentence call agayne
  Nor hym delyuer: o fole thou mayst complayne
  For this thy foly and also it repent
  Thynkest thou nat god alway omnypotent

  Is god nat rightwyse and grounde of all iustyce
  Rewardynge man after his gouernaunce
  He that hath here nat lyen in synne and vyce
  Hauynge in goddys seruyce his pleasaunce
  Shall of his lorde be had in remembraunce
  And of rewarde worthely be sure
  Where it is worthy that synners payne endure

  Trust well who seruyth his maker stedfastly
  With pure herte kepynge sure his commaundement
  And lawes shall be rewardyd fynally
  With heuenly ioy and scape all punysshement
  Therfore thou fole leue of this lewde intent
  Lyue vertuously and trust in goddes grace
  Than yll desteny in the shall haue no place

  Vnto great ioy god hath vs all create
  And to vs all ordeyned his kyngdome
  And none hath vnto Hell predestynate
  But often whan we folowe nat wysdome
  By ouer owne foly we fall, and so become
  Vnto our maker vnkind: and hym deny
  Whiche them rewardyth that here lyue vertuously

  Therfore thou Fole desyst thy wordes vayne
  And let thy tunge no more suche wordes say
  For god hath vs made all of one stuf certayne
  As one potter makyth of one clay
  Vessels dyuers, but whan he must them lay

  They come nat all to good, moste comonly

  Saynge why dost thou make me in this wyse
  Wherfore mad man I reade the to be styll

  That if it fortune them on the same to loke
  They may therby perceyue in theyr corage
  That labour they ought for their owne auauntage

  A fygure made vnto hymselfe semblable
  Whiche he in marbyll right craftely dyd frame
  And in so moche he worshypped the same
  Tyll at the last his mynde was past and gone
  And he transformed so was in to that stone

  And if the Poetis fables be all sure
  As by theyr subtyle wordes oft we here
  The childe Narcissus was chaungyd of fygure
  Whyle he behelde into the water clere
  For whyle his shadowe vnto hym dyd apere
  Vpon the same so sore he set his mynde
  That he transformyd was to another kynde.

  But to retorne agayne to our purpose
  And of this sort of Folys to conclude
  If god sholde them to other shape transpose
  That thynke them fayre though they be foule and rude
  Into foule fassyon he many sholde include
  For whyle Folys theyr owne beauty magnyfy
  So growyth the nomber and so they multyply

Bysyde the stere for troublynge of his pate

Suche lese theyr tyme in vayne and oft therin
Ar many hurtis: and cause of dedely syn.]

  Those folys a place may chalenge in my shyp
  Whiche voyde of wysdome as men out of theyr mynde
  Them selfe delyte to daunce to lepe and skyp
  In compase rennynge lyke to the worlde wyde
  In vnkynde labour, suche folys pleasour fynde
  Rennynge about in this theyr furyous vyce
  Lyke as it were in Bacchus sacryfyce

  Or as the Druydans rennyth in vayne about
  In theyr mad festes vpon the hylle of yde
  Makynge theyr sacrafyce with furour noyse and shout
  Whan theyr madnes settyth theyr wyt asyde
  Or whan the prestis of mars all nyght abyde
  Within theyr temple by vse abhomynable
  To theyr ydollys doynge theyr seruyce detestable

  Lyke as these paynyms hath to theyr ydols done
  Theyr sacryfyce wandrynge in theyr madnes
  Theyr bodyes weryenge, in vayne wastynge their shone
  So do these fowlys them selfe to daunsynge dres
  Sekynge occason of great vnhappynes
  They take suche labour without all hope of gayne
  Without rewarde sure, of werynes and payne

  Say Folys that vse this fury and outrage
  What causyth you to haue delyte therin
  For your great labour say what is your wage
  Forsoth ye can therby no profyte wyn
  But seke occasyon (as I haue sayde) of syn
  And for thy werynge thy fete thus in the dust
  Thou gettest no gayne but cause of carnall lust

  But whan I consyder of this folysshe game
  The firste begynnynge and cause orygynall
  I say the cause therof is worthy blame
  For whan the deuyll to disceyue man mortall
  And do contempt to the hye god eternall
  Vpon a stage had set a Calfe of golde.
  That euery man the same myght clere beholde

  So than the Fende grounde of mysgouernaunce
  Causyd the people this fygure to honour
  As for theyr god and before the same to daunce.
  Whan they were dronkon, thus fell they in errour
  Of Idolatry, and forgate theyr creatour.
  Before this ydoll daunsynge both wyfe and man
  Dispysynge god: Thus daunsynge fyrst began

  Suche blynde folyes and inconuenyence
  Engendryth great hurte and incommodyte
  And sawyth sede wherof groweth great offence
  The grounde of vyce and of all enormyte
  In it is pryde, fowle lust and lecherye
  And whyle lewde lepys ar vysd in the daunce
  Oft frowarde bargayns ar made by countenaunce

  What els is daunsynge but euen a nurcery
  Or els a bayte to purchase and meyntayne
  In yonge hertis the vyle synne of rybawdry
  Them fe*trynge therin, as in a dedely chayne
  And to say trouth in wordes clere and playne
  Venereous people haue all theyr hole pleasaunce
  Theyr vyce to norysshe by this vnthryfty daunce

  And wanton people disposyd vnto syn
  To satysfye theyr mad concupyscence
  With hasty cours vnto this daunsynge ryn
  To seke occasyon of vyle synne and offence
  And to expresse my mynde in short sentence
  This vyciouse game oft tymes doth attyse
  By his lewde synes, chast hartis vnto vyce

  Than it in erth no game is more damnable
  It semyth no peas, but Batayle openly
  They that it vse of myndes seme vnstable
  As mad folke rennynge with clamour showt and cry
  What place is voyde of this furyous foly
  None: so that I dout within a whyle
  These folys the holy churche shall defyle

  Of people what sort or order may we fynde
  Ryche or pore hye or lowe of name
  But by theyr folysshnes, and wanton mynde
  Of eche sort some ar gyuen vnto the same
  The prestis and clerkes to daunce haue no shame
  The frere or monke in his frocke and cowle
  Must daunce in his dortor lepynge to play the fole

  To it comys children, maydes and wyues.
  And flaterynge yonge men to se to haue theyr pray
  The hande in hande great falshode oft contryues
  The olde quean also this madnes wyll assay
  And the olde dotarde thoughe he skantly may
  For age and lamenes stere outher fote or hande
  Yet playeth he the fole with other in the bande

  Than lepe they about as folke past theyr mynde
  With madnes amasyd rennynge in compace
  He moste is commendyd that can moste lewdnes fynde
  Or can most quyckly ren about the place
  There ar all maners vsyd that lacke grace
  Mouynge theyr bodyes in synes full of shame
  Whiche doth theyr hertes to synne right sore inflame

  So oft this vyce doth many one abuse
  That whan they ar departyd from the daunce
  On lust and synne contynually they muse
  Hauynge therin theyr wyll and theyr pleasaunce
  Than fall they oft to great mysgouernaunce
  As folys gyuyn to worke vnprofytable
  So in my shyp they well deserue a babyll.
