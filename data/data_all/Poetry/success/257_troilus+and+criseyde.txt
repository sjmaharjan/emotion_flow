BOOK I. Incipit Liber Primus

                 The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen,                1
               That was the king Priamus sone of Troye,
               In lovinge, how his aventures fellen
               Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye,
               My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye.                   5
               Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte
               Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte!

               To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment,
               Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne;
               Help me, that am the sorwful instrument                10
               That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne!
               For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne,
               A woful wight to han a drery fere,
               And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.

               For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve,              15
               Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse,
               Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve,
               So fer am I fro his help in derknesse;
               But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse
               To any lover, and his cause avayle,                    20
               Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle!

               But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse,
               If any drope of pitee in yow be,
               Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse
               That ye han felt, and on the adversitee                25
               Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye
               Han felt that Love dorste yow displese;
               Or ye han wonne hym with to greet an ese.

               And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas
               Of Troilus, as ye may after here,                      30
               That love hem bringe in hevene to solas,
               And eek for me preyeth to god so dere,
               That I have might to shewe, in som manere,
               Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure,
               In Troilus unsely aventure.                            35

               And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred
               In love, that never nil recovered be,
               And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred
               Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she;
               Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee,                  40
               So graunte hem sone out of this world to pace,
               That been despeyred out of Loves grace.

               And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese,
               That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce,
               And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese,            45
               That it to Love be worship and plesaunce.
               For so hope I my soule best avaunce,
               To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be,
               And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee.

               And for to have of hem compassioun                     50
               As though I were hir owene brother dere.
               Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun,
               For now wol I gon streight to my matere,
               In whiche ye may the double sorwes here
               Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde,                     55
               And how that she forsook him er she deyde.

                 It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge
               In armes with a thousand shippes wente
               To Troyewardes, and the citee longe
               Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente,               60
               And, in diverse wyse and oon entente,
               The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne,
               By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne.

               Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was
               Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee,                  65
               A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas,
               That in science so expert was, that he
               Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be,
               By answere of his god, that highte thus,
               Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus.                       70

               So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge,
               And eek by answere of this Appollo,
               That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe,
               Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do,
               He caste anoon out of the toun to go;                  75
               For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde
               Destroyed ben, ye, wolde who-so nolde.

               For which, for to departen softely
               Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse,
               And to the Grekes ost ful prively                      80
               He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse,
               Hym deden bothe worship and servyse,
               In trust that he hath conning hem to rede
               In every peril which that is to drede.

               The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed,           85
               Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken,
               That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed
               With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken
               On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken;
               And seyden, he and al his kin at ones                  90
               Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones.

               Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce,
               Al unwist of this false and wikked dede,
               His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce,
               For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede,              95
               As she that niste what was best to rede;
               For bothe a widowe was she, and allone
               Of any freend to whom she dorste hir mone.

               Criseyde was this lady name a-right;
               As to my dome, in al Troyes citee                     100
               Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight
               So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee,
               That lyk a thing immortal semed she,
               As doth an hevenish parfit creature,
               That doun were sent in scorning of nature.            105

               This lady, which that al-day herde at ere
               Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun,
               Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere,
               In widewes habit large of samit broun,
               On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun;                 110
               With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge,
               His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge.

               Now was this Ector pitous of nature,
               And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon,
               And that she was so fair a creature;                  115
               Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon,
               And seyde, `Lat your fadres treson goon
               Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in Ioye,
               Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye.

               `And al thonour that men may doon yow have,           120
               As ferforth as your fader dwelled here,
               Ye shul han, and your body shal men save,
               As fer as I may ought enquere or here.'
               And she him thonked with ful humble chere,
               And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille,          125
               And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille.

               And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee
               As to hir honour nede was to holde;
               And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee,
               Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde          130
               Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde.
               But whether that she children hadde or noon,
               I rede it naught; therfore I late it goon.

               The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre,
               Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte;                135
               For som day boughten they of Troye it derre,
               And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe
               The folk of Troye; and thus fortune on-lofte,
               And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe
               After hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe.            140

               But how this toun com to destruccioun
               Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle;
               For it were a long digressioun
               Fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle.
               But the Troyane gestes, as they felle,                145
               In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte,
               Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte.

               But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten,
               And hir citee bisegede al a-boute,
               Hir olde usage wolde they not letten,                 150
               As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute;
               But aldermost in honour, out of doute,
               They hadde a relik hight Palladion,
               That was hir trist a-boven everichon.

               And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme                 155
               Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede
               With newe grene, of lusty Ver the pryme,
               And swote smellen floures whyte and rede,
               In sondry wyses shewed, as I rede,
               The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde,              160
               Palladiones feste for to holde.

               And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse,
               In general, ther wente many a wight,
               To herknen of Palladion servyse;
               And namely, so many a lusty knight,                   165
               So many a lady fresh and mayden bright,
               Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste,
               Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste.

               Among thise othere folk was Criseyda,
               In widewes habite blak; but nathelees,                170
               Right as our firste lettre is now an A,
               In beautee first so stood she, makelees;
               Hir godly looking gladede al the prees.
               Nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre,
               Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre              175

               As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon
               That hir behelden in hir blake wede;
               And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon,
               Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede,
               And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede,            180
               Simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere,
               With ful assured loking and manere.

               This Troilus, as he was wont to gyde
               His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun
               In thilke large temple on every syde,                 185
               Biholding ay the ladyes of the toun,
               Now here, now there, for no devocioun
               Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste,
               But gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste.

               And in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten             190
               If knight or squyer of his companye
               Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten
               On any woman that he coude aspye;
               He wolde smyle, and holden it folye,
               And seye him thus, `god wot, she slepeth softe        195
               For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte!

               `I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge,
               Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces,
               And which a labour folk han in winninge
               Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces;        200
               And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces;
               O verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye;
               Ther nis not oon can war by other be.'

               And with that word he gan cast up the browe,
               Ascaunces, `Lo! is this nought wysly spoken?'         205
               At which the god of love gan loken rowe
               Right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken;
               He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken;
               For sodeynly he hit him at the fulle;
               And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle.                210

               O blinde world, O blinde entencioun!
               How ofte falleth al theffect contraire
               Of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun;
               For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire.
               This Troilus is clomben on the staire,                215
               And litel weneth that he moot descenden.
               But al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden.

               As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe
               Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn,
               Til he a lash have of the longe whippe,               220
               Than thenketh he, `Though I praunce al biforn
               First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn,
               Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe
               I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.'

               So ferde it by this fers and proude knight;           225
               Though he a worthy kinges sone were,
               And wende nothing hadde had swiche might
               Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere,
               Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere,
               That he, that now was most in pryde above,            230
               Wex sodeynly most subget un-to love.

               For-thy ensample taketh of this man,
               Ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle,
               To scornen Love, which that so sone can
               The freedom of your hertes to him thralle;            235
               For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle,
               That Love is he that alle thing may binde;
               For may no man for-do the lawe of kinde.

               That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet;
               For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some,             240
               Men reden not that folk han gretter wit
               Than they that han be most with love y-nome;
               And strengest folk ben therwith overcome,
               The worthiest and grettest of degree:
               This was, and is, and yet men shal it see.            245

               And trewelich it sit wel to be so;
               For alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed;
               And they that han ben aldermost in wo,
               With love han ben conforted most and esed;
               And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed,              250
               And worthy folk maad worthier of name,
               And causeth most to dreden vyce and shame.

               Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde,
               And is a thing so vertuous in kinde,
               Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde,                 255
               Sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde.
               The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde
               Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede
               To folwen him that so wel can yow lede.

               But for to tellen forth in special                    260
               As of this kinges sone of which I tolde,
               And leten other thing collateral,
               Of him thenke I my tale for to holde,
               Both of his Ioye, and of his cares colde;
               And al his werk, as touching this matere,             265
               For I it gan, I wol ther-to refere.

               With-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge,
               This Troilus, of every wight aboute,
               On this lady and now on that lokinge,
               Wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute:           270
               And up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route
               His eye perced, and so depe it wente,
               Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente.

               And sodeynly he wax ther-with astoned,
               And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse:             275
               `O mercy, god!' thoughte he, `wher hastow woned,
               That art so fair and goodly to devyse?'
               Ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse,
               And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here,
               And caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere.         280

               She nas nat with the leste of hir stature,
               But alle hir limes so wel answeringe
               Weren to womanhode, that creature
               Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge.
               And eek the pure wyse of here meninge                 285
               Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse
               Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse.

               To Troilus right wonder wel with-alle
               Gan for to lyke hir meninge and hir chere,
               Which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle          290
               Hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere,
               Ascaunces, `What! May I not stonden here?'
               And after that hir loking gan she lighte,
               That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte.

               And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken             295
               So greet desir, and swich affeccioun,
               That in his herte botme gan to stiken
               Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun:
               And though he erst hadde poured up and doun,
               He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke;             300
               Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke.

               Lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge,
               And scorned hem that loves peynes dryen,
               Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge
               With-inne the subtile stremes of hir yen;             305
               That sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen,
               Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte;
               Blissed be love, that thus can folk converte!

               She, this in blak, likinge to Troylus,
               Over alle thyng, he stood for to biholde;             310
               Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus,
               He neither chere made, ne worde tolde;
               But from a-fer, his maner for to holde,
               On other thing his look som-tyme he caste,
               And eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste.              315

               And after this, not fulliche al awhaped,
               Out of the temple al esiliche he wente,
               Repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped
               Of loves folk, lest fully the descente
               Of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente,       320
               Lest it were wist on any maner syde,
               His wo he gan dissimulen and hyde.

               Whan he was fro the temple thus departed,
               He streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth,
               Right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted,  325
               Al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth;
               And al his chere and speche also he borneth;
               And ay, of loves servants every whyle,
               Him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle.

               And seyde, `Lord, so ye live al in lest,              330
               Ye loveres! For the conningest of yow,
               That serveth most ententiflich and best,
               Him tit as often harm ther-of as prow;
               Your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how!
               Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse;       335
               In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse!

               `In noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces,
               But it a sely fewe poyntes be;
               Ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces
               As doth youre lay, and that knowe alle ye;            340
               But that is not the worste, as mote I thee;
               But, tolde I yow the worste poynt, I leve,
               Al seyde I sooth, ye wolden at me greve!

               `But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe,
               Or elles doon of good entencioun,                     345
               Ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue,
               And deme it harm in hir opinioun;
               And yet if she, for other enchesoun,
               Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon:
               Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!'             350

               But for al this, whan that he say his tyme,
               He held his pees, non other bote him gayned;
               For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme,
               That wel unnethe un-to his folk he fayned
               That othere besye nedes him destrayned;               355
               For wo was him, that what to doon he niste,
               But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste.

               And whan that he in chaumbre was allone,
               He doun up-on his beddes feet him sette,
               And first be gan to syke, and eft to grone,           360
               And thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette,
               That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette
               That he hir saw a temple, and al the wyse
               Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse.

               Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde,               365
               In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure;
               And that he wel coude in his herte finde,
               It was to him a right good aventure
               To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure
               To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace,          370
               Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace.

               Imagininge that travaille nor grame
               Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn
               As she, ne him for his desir ne shame,
               Al were it wist, but in prys and up-born              375
               Of alle lovers wel more than biforn;
               Thus argumented he in his ginninge,
               Ful unavysed of his wo cominge.

               Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe,
               And thoughte he wolde werken prively,                 380
               First, to hyden his desir in muwe
               From every wight y-born, al-outrely,
               But he mighte ought recovered be therby;
               Remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe
               Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe.         385

               And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte
               What for to speke, and what to holden inne,
               And what to arten hir to love he soughte,
               And on a song anoon-right to biginne,
               And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne;              390
               For with good hope he gan fully assente
               Criseyde for to love, and nought repente.

               And of his song nought only the sentence,
               As writ myn autour called Lollius,
               But pleynly, save our tonges difference,              395
               I dar wel sayn, in al that Troilus
               Seyde in his song, lo! every word right thus
               As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here,
               Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here.

                  Cantus Troili.

               `If no love is, O god, what fele I so?                400
               And if love is, what thing and whiche is he!
               If love be good, from whennes comth my wo?
               If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me,
               Whenne every torment and adversitee
               That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke;          405
               For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke.

               `And if that at myn owene lust I brenne,
               Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte?
               If harme agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne?
               I noot, ne why unwery that I feynte.                  410
               O quike deeth, O swete harm so queynte,
               How may of thee in me swich quantitee,
               But-if that I consente that it be?

               `And if that I consente, I wrongfully
               Compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro,             415
               Al sterelees with inne a boot am I
               A-mid the see, by-twixen windes two,
               That in contrarie stonden ever-mo.
               Allas! what is this wonder maladye?
               For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deye.'          420

               And to the god of love thus seyde he
               With pitous voys, `O lord, now youres is
               My spirit, which that oughte youres be.
               Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to this;
               But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis,                425
               She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve;
               But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve.

               `Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily,
               As in a place un-to youre vertu digne;
               Wherfore, lord, if my servyse or I                    430
               May lyke yow, so beth to me benigne;
               For myn estat royal here I resigne
               In-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere
               Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.'

               In him ne deyned sparen blood royal                   435
               The fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse,
               Ne him forbar in no degree, for al
               His vertu or his excellent prowesse;
               But held him as his thral lowe in distresse,
               And brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe,             440
               That sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe.

               So muche, day by day, his owene thought,
               For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese,
               That every other charge he sette at nought;
               For-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese,               445
               To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese;
               For ther-by to ben esed wel he wende,
               And ay the ner he was, the more he brende.

               For ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is,
               This, trowe I, knoweth al this companye.              450
               But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this,
               By night or day, for wisdom or folye,
               His herte, which that is his brestes ye,
               Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene
               Than ever were Eleyne or Polixene.                    455

               Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre
               That to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde,
               `Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure,
               As I best can, now wolde god, Criseyde,
               Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deyde!                 460
               My dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe
               And lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.'

               Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde,
               Both of the assege and his savacioun;
               Ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde             465
               But argumentes to his conclusioun,
               That she on him wolde han compassioun,
               And he to be hir man, whyl he may dure;
               Lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure!

               The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve,              470
               That Ector or his othere bretheren diden,
               Ne made him only ther-fore ones meve;
               And yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden,
               Founde oon the beste, and lengest tyme abiden
               Ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle            475
               In armes, that to thenke it was mervayle.

               But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde,
               Ne also for the rescous of the toun,
               Ne made him thus in armes for to madde,
               But only, lo, for this conclusioun,                   480
               To lyken hir the bet for his renoun;
               Fro day to day in armes so he spedde,
               That alle the Grekes as the deeth him dredde.

               And fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep,
               And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe          485
               Gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep,
               It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe;
               Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe
               Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende
               That the hote fyr of love him brende,                 490

               And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis;
               But how it was, certayn, can I not seye,
               If that his lady understood not this,
               Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye;
               But wel I rede that, by no maner weye,                495
               Ne semed it as that she of him roughte,
               Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte.

               But than fel to this Troylus such wo,
               That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede
               Was this, that she som wight had loved so,            500
               That never of him she wolde have taken hede;
               For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede.
               Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne

               But whanne he hadde a space fro his care,             505
               Thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne;
               He sayde, `O fool, now art thou in the snare,

               Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte.
               Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte;

               This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe,
               Ful often seyde, `Allas! what may this be?

               Than gan this sorwful Troilus to syke,
               And seyde him thus, "God leve it be my beste

               And with that, Pandare of his wordes stente;

               Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is un-sought.
               What! Many a man hath love ful dere y-bought          810
               Twenty winter that his lady wiste,

               Of that word took hede Troilus,                       820
               And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne,
               And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus,
               That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne,
               But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne,
               And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte;             825
               For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte.

               And with that thought he gan ful sore syke,
               And seyde, `Allas! What is me best to do?'
               To whom Pandare answered, `If thee lyke,
               The best is that thou telle me thy wo;                830
               And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so,
               I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe,
               To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!'

               `Ye, so thou seyst,' quod Troilus tho, `allas!
               But, god wot, it is not the rather so;                835
               Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas,
               For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo,
               Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go
               May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde;
               For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and bonde.'   840

               Quod Pandarus, `Than blamestow Fortune
               For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see;
               Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune

               What wostow if hir mutabilitee
               Right as thy-selven list, wol doon by thee,
               Or that she be not fer fro thyn helpinge?
               Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe!

               `And therfor wostow what I thee beseche?              855

               To him bihoveth first unwrye his wounde.
               To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde,

               By my wil, she sholde al be thyn to-morwe.
               `Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is
               Anoon, that I may goon aboute thy nede;
               Knowe ich hir ought? For my love, tel me this;
               Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.'              865
               Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede,
               For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame;
               `A ha!' quod Pandare, `Here biginneth game!'

               And with that word he gan him for to shake,
               And seyde, `Theef, thou shalt hir name telle.'        870
               But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake
               As though men sholde han led him in-to helle,
               And seyde, `Allas! Of al my wo the welle,

               And wel nigh with the word for fere he deyde.         875

               And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene,
               Lord, he was glad, and seyde, `Freend so dere,

               Whan Troilus had herd Pandare assented
               To been his help in loving of Criseyde,              1010
               Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented,
               But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde,
               With sobre chere, al-though his herte pleyde,
               `Now blisful Venus helpe, er that I sterve,
               Of thee, Pandare, I may som thank deserve.           1015

               `But, dere frend, how shal myn wo ben lesse
               Til this be doon? And goode, eek tel me this,
               How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse?
               Lest she be wrooth, this drede I most, y-wys,
               Or nil not here or trowen how it is.                 1020
               Al this drede I, and eek for the manere
               Of thee, hir eem, she nil no swich thing here.'

               Quod Pandarus, `Thou hast a ful gret care
               Lest that the cherl may falle out of the mone!
               Why, lord! I hate of the thy nyce fare!              1025
               Why, entremete of that thou hast to done!
               For goddes love, I bidde thee a bone,
               So lat me alone, and it shal be thy beste.' --
               `Why, freend,' quod he, `now do right as the leste.

               `But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde             1030
               That thou in me wendest so greet folye,
               That to my lady I desiren sholde
               That toucheth harm or any vilenye;
               For dredelees, me were lever dye
               Than she of me ought elles understode                1035
               But that, that mighte sounen in-to gode.'

               Tho lough this Pandare, and anoon answerde,
               `And I thy borw? Fy! No wight dooth but so;
               I roughte nought though that she stode and herde
               How that thou seyst; but fare-wel, I wol go.         1040
               A-dieu! Be glad! God spede us bothe two!
               Yif me this labour and this besinesse,
               And of my speed be thyn al that swetnesse.'

               Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle,
               And Pandare in his armes hente faste,                1045
               And seyde, `Now, fy on the Grekes alle!
               Yet, pardee, god shal helpe us at the laste;
               And dredelees, if that my lyf may laste,
               And god to-forn, lo, som of hem shal smerte;
               And yet me athinketh that this avaunt me asterte!    1050

               `Now, Pandare, I can no more seye,
               But thou wys, thou wost, thou mayst, thou art al!
               My lyf, my deeth, hool in thyn bonde I leye;
               Help now,' Quod he, `Yis, by my trouthe, I shal.'
               `God yelde thee, freend, and this in special,'       1055
               Quod Troilus, `that thou me recomaunde
               To hir that to the deeth me may comaunde.'

               This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve
               His fulle freend, than seyde in this manere,         1059
               `Far-wel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve;
               Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt wel here.' --
               And wente his wey, thenking on this matere,
               And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace,
               And finde a tyme ther-to, and a place.

               For every wight that hath an hous to founde          1065
               Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne
               With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde,
               And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne
               Alderfirst his purpos for to winne.
               Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte,               1070
               And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte.

               But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun,
               But up anoon up-on his stede bay,
               And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun;
               Wo was that Greek that with him mette that day.      1075
               And in the toun his maner tho forth ay
               So goodly was, and gat him so in grace,
               That ech him lovede that loked on his face.

               For he bicom the frendlyeste wight,
               The gentileste, and eek the moste free,              1080
               The thriftieste and oon the beste knight,
               That in his tyme was, or mighte be.
               Dede were his Iapes and his crueltee,
               His heighe port and his manere estraunge,
               And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge.              1085

               Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde,
               That fareth lyk a man that hurt is sore,
               And is somdel of akinge of his wounde
               Y-lissed wel, but heled no del more:
               And, as an esy pacient, the lore                     1090
               Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure;
               And thus he dryveth forth his aventure.

               Of al this werk, but prey yow mekely,
               Disblameth me if any word be lame,

               Eek though I speke of love unfelingly,

               And thenketh, so nolde I nat love purchace,
               Or wondreth on his speche or his doinge,

               That he hadde seyd, as it com hir to minde;

               And wex somdel astonied in hir thought,

               With that gan al hir meynee for to shoute,

               That shal bityden of necessitee.

               This Troilus sat on his baye stede,
               Al armed, save his heed, ful richely,                 625
               And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede,
               On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely;

               So lyk a man of armes and a knight

               To doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse;
               And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse,           635
               So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he,
               It was an heven up-on him for to see.

               His helm to-hewen was in twenty places,
               That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde,
               His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces,      640
               In which men mighte many an arwe finde
               That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde;
               And ay the peple cryde, `Here cometh our Ioye,
               And, next his brother, holdere up of Troye!'

               For which he wex a litel reed for shame,              645
               Whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen,
               That to biholde it was a noble game,
               How sobreliche he caste doun his yen.
               Cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen,
               And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke,              650
               That to hir-self she seyde, `Who yaf me drinke?'

               For of hir owene thought she wex al reed,
               Remembringe hir right thus, `Lo, this is he
               Which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed,
               But I on him have mercy and pitee;'                   655
               And with that thought, for pure a-shamed, she
               Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste,
               Whyl he and al the peple for-by paste,

               And gan to caste and rollen up and doun
               With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse,         660
               And his estat, and also his renoun,
               His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse;
               But most hir favour was, for his distresse
               Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe
               To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe.         665

               Now mighte som envyous Iangle thus,
               `This was a sodeyn love; how mighte it be
               That she so lightly lovede Troilus
               Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?'
               Now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee!              670
               For every thing, a ginning hath it nede
               Er al be wrought, with-outen any drede.

               For I sey nought that she so sodeynly
               Yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne
               To lyke him first, and I have told yow why;           675
               And after that, his manhod and his pyne
               Made love with-inne hir for to myne,
               For which, by proces and by good servyse,
               He gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse.

               And also blisful Venus, wel arayed,                   680
               Sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho,
               Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed,
               To helpen sely Troilus of his wo.
               And, sooth to seyn, she nas not al a fo
               To Troilus in his nativitee;                          685
               God woot that wel the soner spedde he.

               Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe,
               That rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste
               Un-to Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe,
               Ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste              690
               Wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste,
               If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse,
               For Troilus, up-on hir for to presse.

               And, lord! So she gan in hir thought argue
               In this matere of which I have yow told,              695
               And what to doon best were, and what eschue,
               That plyted she ful ofte in many fold.
               Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold,
               And what she thoughte somwhat shal I wryte,
               As to myn auctor listeth for to endyte.               700

               She thoughte wel that Troilus persone
               She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse,
               And thus she seyde, `Al were it nought to done,
               To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse,
               It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse,         705
               In honestee, with swich a lord to dele,
               For myn estat, and also for his hele.

               `Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he;
               And sith he hath to see me swich delyt,
               If I wolde utterly his sighte flee,                   710
               Peraunter he mighte have me in dispyt,
               Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plyt;
               Now were I wys, me hate to purchace,
               With-outen nede, ther I may stonde in grace?

               `In every thing, I woot, ther lyth mesure.            715
               For though a man forbede dronkenesse,
               He nought for-bet that every creature
               Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse;
               Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse,
               I ne oughte not for that thing him despyse,           720
               Sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse.

               `And eek I knowe, of longe tyme agoon,
               His thewes goode, and that he is not nyce.
               Ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, he is noon;
               To wys is he to do so gret a vyce;                    725
               Ne als I nel him never so cheryce,
               That he may make avaunt, by Iuste cause;
               He shal me never binde in swiche a clause.

               `Now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis,
               Men mighten deme that he loveth me;                   730
               What dishonour were it un-to me, this?
               May I him lette of that? Why nay, pardee!
               I knowe also, and alday here and see,
               Men loven wommen al this toun aboute;
               Be they the wers? Why, nay, with-outen doute.         735

               `I thenk eek how he able is for to have
               Of al this noble toun the thriftieste,
               To been his love, so she hir honour save;
               For out and out he is the worthieste,
               Save only Ector, which that is the beste.             740
               And yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure,
               But swich is love, and eek myn aventure.

               `Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought;
               For wel wot I my-self, so god me spede,
               Al wolde I that noon wiste of this thought,           745
               I am oon the fayreste, out of drede,
               And goodlieste, who-so taketh hede;
               And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye.
               What wonder is it though he of me have Ioye?

               `I am myn owene woman, wel at ese,                    750
               I thank it god, as after myn estat;
               Right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese,
               With-outen Ialousye or swich debat;
               Shal noon housbonde seyn to me "Chekmat!"
               For either they ben ful of Ialousye,                  755
               Or maisterful, or loven novelrye.

               `What shal I doon? To what fyn live I thus?
               Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste?
               What, par dieux! I am nought religious!
               And though that I myn herte sette at reste            760
               Upon this knight, that is the worthieste,
               And kepe alwey myn honour and my name,
               By alle right, it may do me no shame.'

               But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte,
               In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,          765
               And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte
               Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space,
               A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace,
               That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle,
               So that for fere almost she gan to falle.             770

               That thought was this: `Allas! Sin I am free,
               Sholde I now love, and putte in Iupartye
               My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee?
               Allas! How dorste I thenken that folye?
               May I nought wel in other folk aspye                  775
               Hir dredful Ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne?
               Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne.

               `For love is yet the moste stormy lyf,
               Right of him-self, that ever was bigonne;
               For ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf,                 780
               Ther is in love, som cloud is over that sonne:
               Ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne,
               Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke;
               Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke.

               `Also these wikked tonges been so prest               785

               That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest,
               So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe:
               But harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe.
               For though these men for love hem first to-rende,     790
               Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende.

               `How ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be,
               The treson, that to womman hath be do?
               To what fyn is swich love, I can nat see,

               Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so,

               `How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be
               To plesen hem that Iangle of love, and demen,         800
               And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me?
               For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen
               Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen;
               And who may stoppen every wikked tonge,
               Or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?'           805

               And after that, hir thought bigan to clere,
               And seyde, `He which that no-thing under-taketh,
               No thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.'
               And with an other thought hir herte quaketh;
               Than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh;           810
               Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye,
               She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye.

               Adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente
               In-to the gardin, with hir neces three,
               And up and doun ther made many a wente,               815
               Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone,

               This yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes,      820
               And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene,
               And benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes,

               She seyde, `O love, to whom I have and shal

               This is the righte lyf that I am inne,

               That she and al hir folk in wente y-fere.             910

               So whan it lyked hir to goon to reste,
               And voyded weren they that voyden oughte,
               She seyde, that to slepe wel hir leste.
               Hir wommen sone til hir bed hir broughte.
               Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte   915
               Of al this thing the manere and the wyse.
               Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wyse.

               A nightingale, upon a cedre grene,
               Under the chambre-wal ther as she lay,
               Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene,                  920
               Paraunter, in his briddes wyse, a lay
               Of love, that made hir herte fresh and gay.
               That herkned she so longe in good entente,
               Til at the laste the dede sleep hir hente.

               And as she sleep, anoon-right tho hir mette,          925
               How that an egle, fethered whyt as boon,
               Under hir brest his longe clawes sette,
               And out hir herte he rente, and that a-noon,
               And dide his herte in-to hir brest to goon,
               Of which she nought agroos, ne no-thing smerte,       930
               And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte.

               Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde
               Of Troilus, that is to paleys riden,
               Fro the scarmuch, of the whiche I tolde,
               And in his chaumbre sit, and hath abiden              935
               Til two or three of his messages yeden
               For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste,
               Til they him founde and broughte him at the laste.

               This Pandarus com leping in at ones,
               And seiyde thus: `Who hath ben wel y-bete             940
               To-day with swerdes, and with slinge-stones,
               But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?'
               And gan to Iape, and seyde, `Lord, so ye swete!
               But rys, and lat us soupe and go to reste;'           944
               And he answerde him, `Do we as thee leste.'

               With al the haste goodly that they mighte,
               They spedde hem fro the souper un-to bedde;
               And every wight out at the dore him dighte,
               And wher him liste upon his wey him spedde;
               But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde           950
               For wo, til that he herde som tydinge,
               He seyde, `Freend, shal I now wepe or singe?'

               Quod Pandarus, `Ly stille and lat me slepe,
               And don thyn hood, thy nedes spedde be;
               And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe;      955
               At shorte wordes, thow shal trowe me. --
               Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee,
               And love thee best, by god and by my trouthe,
               But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe.

               `For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne,           960
               Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe,
               Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne,
               And also hath she leyd hir feyth to borwe.
               Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.'
               What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde?              965
               As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde.

               But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night
               Y-closed, stoupen on hir stalke lowe,
               Redressen hem a-yein the sonne bright,
               And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe,               970
               Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe
               This Troilus, and seyde, `O Venus dere,
               Thy might, thy grace, y-heried be it here!'

               And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes,
               And seyde, `Lord, al thyn be that I have;             975
               For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes;
               A thousand Troians who so that me yave,
               Eche after other, god so wis me save,

               `But Lord, how shal I doon, how shal I liven?
               Whan shal I next my dere herte see?
               How shal this longe tyme a-wey be driven,

               `Al esily, now, for the love of Marte,'
               Quod Pandarus, `for every thing hath tyme;

               `I woot wel that thow wyser art than I

               Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it wryte;
               Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lyte;
               And if thou wryte a goodly word al softe,
               Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte.

               `For though the beste harpour upon lyve              1030

               With asses feet, and hede it as an ape,
               It cordeth nought; so nere it but a Iape.'

               This counseyl lyked wel to Troilus;
               But, as a dreedful lover, he seyde this: --          1045
               `Allas, my dere brother Pandarus,
               I am ashamed for to wryte, y-wis,
               Lest of myn innocence I seyde a-mis,
               Or that she nolde it for despyt receyve;
               Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it no-thing weyve.'  1050

               To that Pandare answerde, `If thee lest,
               Do that I seye, and lat me therwith goon;
               For by that lord that formed est and west,
               I hope of it to bringe answere anoon
               Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon,       1055
               Lat be; and sory mote he been his lyve,
               Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thryve.'

               Quod Troilus, `Depardieux, I assente;
               Sin that thee list, I will aryse and wryte;
               And blisful god preye ich, with good entente,        1060
               The vyage, and the lettre I shal endyte,
               So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the whyte,
               Yif thou me wit my lettre to devyse:'
               And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wyse. --

               First he gan hir his righte lady calle,              1065
               His hertes lyf, his lust, his sorwes leche,
               His blisse, and eek these othere termes alle,
               That in swich cas these loveres alle seche;
               And in ful humble wyse, as in his speche,
               He gan him recomaunde un-to hir grace;               1070
               To telle al how, it axeth muchel space.

               And after this, ful lowly he hir prayde
               To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folye,
               So hardy was to hir to wryte, and seyde,
               That love it made, or elles moste he dye,            1075
               And pitously gan mercy for to crye;
               And after that he seyde, and ley ful loude,
               Him-self was litel worth, and lesse he coude;

               And that she sholde han his conning excused,
               That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so,            1080
               And his unworthinesse he ay acused;
               And after that, than gan he telle his woo;
               But that was endeles, with-outen ho;
               And seyde, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde; --
               And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde.         1085

               And with his salte teres gan he bathe
               The ruby in his signet, and it sette
               Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe;
               Ther-with a thousand tymes, er he lette,
               He kiste tho the lettre that he shette,              1090
               And seyde, `Lettre, a blisful destenee
               Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.'

               This Pandare took the lettre, and that by tyme
               A-morwe, and to his neces paleys sterte,
               And faste he swoor, that it was passed pryme,        1095
               And gan to Iape, and seyde, `Y-wis, myn herte,
               So fresh it is, al-though it sore smerte,
               I may not slepe never a Mayes morwe;

               Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde,             1100
               With dreedful herte, and desirous to here
               The cause of his cominge, thus answerde:
               `Now by your feyth, myn uncle,' quod she, `dere,

               `By god,' quod he, `I hoppe alwey bihinde!'
               And she to-laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste.
               Quod Pandarus, `Loke alwey that ye finde

               Al prevely, of this a long sermoun.'                 1115
               With that they wenten arm in arm y-fere
               In-to the gardin from the chaumbre doun.
               And whan that he so fer was that the soun
               Of that he speke, no man here mighte,
               He seyde hir thus, and out the lettre plighte,       1120

               `Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free
               Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace,
               And sent to you this lettre here by me;

               Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille,
               And took it nought, but al hir humble chere
               Gan for to chaunge, and seyde, `Scrit ne bille,      1130

               For trewely I nil no lettre wryte.'
               `No? than wol I,' quod he, `so ye endyte.'

               Therwith she lough, and seyde, `Go we dyne.'
               And he gan at him-self to iape faste,
               And seyde, `Nece, I have so greet a pyne             1165
               For love, that every other day I faste' --
               And gan his beste Iapes forth to caste;
               And made hir so to laughe at his folye,
               That she for laughter wende for to dye.

               And whan that she was comen in-to halle,             1170
               `Now, eem,' quod she, `we wol go dine anoon;'
               And gan some of hir women to hir calle,
               And streyght in-to hir chaumbre gan she goon;
               But of hir besinesses, this was oon
               A-monges othere thinges, out of drede,               1175
               Ful prively this lettre for to rede;

               Avysed word by word in every lyne,
               And fond no lak, she thoughte he coude good;
               And up it putte, and went hir in to dyne.
               But Pandarus, that in a study stood,                 1180
               Er he was war, she took him by the hood,
               And seyde, `Ye were caught er that ye wiste;'
               `I vouche sauf,' quod he. `do what yow liste.'

               Tho wesshen they, and sette hem doun and ete;
               And after noon ful sleyly Pandarus                   1185
               Gan drawe him to the window next the strete,
               And seyde, `Nece, who hath arayed thus
               The yonder hous, that stant afor-yeyn us?'
               `Which hous?' quod she, and gan for to biholde,
               And knew it wel, and whos it was him tolde,          1190

               And fillen forth in speche of thinges smale,
               And seten in the window bothe tweye.
               Whan Pandarus saw tyme un-to his tale,
               And saw wel that hir folk were alle aweye,
               `Now, nece myn, tel on,' quod he; `I seye,           1195
               How liketh yow the lettre that ye woot?
               Can he ther-on? For, by my trouthe, I noot.'

               Therwith al rosy hewed tho wex she,
               And gan to humme, and seyde, `So I trowe.'
               `Aquyte him wel, for goddes love,' quod he;          1200
               `My-self to medes wol the lettre sowe.'
               And held his hondes up, and sat on knowe,
               `Now, goode nece, be it never so lyte,
               Yif me the labour, it to sowe and plyte.'

               `Ye, for I can so wryte,' quod she tho;              1205
               `And eek I noot what I sholde to him seye.'
               `Nay, nece,' quod Pandare, `sey nat so;
               Yet at the leste thanketh him, I preye,
               Of his good wil, and doth him not to deye.
               Now for the love of me, my nece dere,                1210
               Refuseth not at this tyme my preyere.'

               `Depar-dieux,' quod she, `God leve al be wel!
               God help me so, this is the firste lettre
               That ever I wroot, ye, al or any del.'
               And in-to a closet, for to avyse hir bettre,         1215
               She wente allone, and gan hir herte unfettre
               Out of disdaynes prison but a lyte;
               And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre wryte,

               Of which to telle in short is myn entente
               Theffect, as fer as I can understonde: --            1220
               She thonked him of al that he wel mente
               Towardes hir, but holden him in honde
               She nolde nought, ne make hir-selven bonde
               In love, but as his suster, him to plese,
               She wolde fayn to doon his herte an ese.             1225

               She shette it, and to Pandarus in gan goon,
               There as he sat and loked in-to the strete,
               And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon
               Of Iaspre, up-on a quisshin gold y-bete,
               And seyde, `As wisly helpe me god the grete,         1230
               I never dide a thing with more peyne
               Than wryte this, to which ye me constreyne;'

               And took it him: He thonked hir and seyde,
               `God woot, of thing ful ofte looth bigonne
               Cometh ende good; and nece myn, Criseyde,            1235
               That ye to him of hard now ben y-wonne
               Oughte he be glad, by god and yonder sonne!
               For-why men seyth, "Impressiounes lighte
               Ful lightly been ay redy to the flighte.'

               `But ye han pleyed tyraunt neigh to longe,           1240
               And hard was it your herte for to grave;
               Now stint, that ye no longer on it honge,
               Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save.
               But hasteth yow to doon him Ioye have;
               For trusteth wel, to longe y-doon hardnesse          1245
               Causeth despyt ful often, for destresse.'

               And right as they declamed this matere,
               Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende,
               Com ryding with his tenthe some y-fere,
               Al softely, and thiderward gan bende                 1250
               Ther-as they sete, as was his way to wende
               To paleys-ward; and Pandare him aspyde,
               And seyde, `Nece, y-see who cometh here ryde!

               `O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose;
               Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.'             1255
               `Nay, nay,' quod she, and wex as reed as rose.
               With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe
               With dreedful chere, and oft his hewes muwe;
               And up his look debonairly he caste,
               And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste.           1260

               God woot if he sat on his hors a-right,
               Or goodly was beseyn, that ilke day!
               God woot wher he was lyk a manly knight!
               What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray?
               Criseyde, which that alle these thinges say,         1265
               To telle in short, hir lyked al y-fere,
               His persone, his aray, his look, his chere,

               His goodly manere, and his gentillesse,
               So wel, that never, sith that she was born,
               Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse;          1270
               And how-so she hath hard ben her-biforn,
               To god hope I, she hath now caught a thorn,
               She shal not pulle it out this nexte wyke;
               God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke!

               Pandare, which that stood hir faste by,              1275
               Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smyte,
               And seyde, `Nece, I pray yow hertely,
               Tel me that I shal axen yow a lyte:
               A womman, that were of his deeth to wyte,
               With-outen his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe,      1280
               Were it wel doon?' Quod she, `Nay, by my trouthe!'

               `God help me so,' quod he, `ye sey me sooth.
               Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye;
               Lo, yond he rit!' Quod she, `Ye, so he dooth!'
               `Wel,' quod Pandare, `as I have told yow thrye,      1285
               Lat be youre nyce shame and youre folye,
               And spek with him in esing of his herte;
               Lat nycetee not do yow bothe smerte.'

               But ther-on was to heven and to done;
               Considered al thing, it may not be;                  1290
               And why, for shame; and it were eek to sone
               To graunten him so greet a libertee.
               `For playnly hir entente,' as seyde she,
               `Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte,
               And guerdon him with no-thing but with sighte.'      1295

               But Pandarus thoughte, `It shal not be so,
               If that I may; this nyce opinioun
               Shal not be holden fully yeres two.'
               What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?
               He moste assente on that conclusioun,                1300
               As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve,
               And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.

               And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde,
               And right for Ioye he felte his herte daunce;
               And Troilus he fond alone a-bedde,                   1305
               That lay as dooth these loveres, in a traunce,
               Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce.
               But Pandarus, right at his in-cominge,
               He song, as who seyth, `Lo! Sumwhat I bringe,'

               And seyde, `Who is in his bed so sone                1310
               Y-buried thus?' `It am I, freend,' quod he.
               `Who, Troilus? Nay, helpe me so the mone,'
               Quod Pandarus, `Thou shalt aryse and see
               A charme that was sent right now to thee,
               The which can helen thee of thyn accesse,            1315
               If thou do forth-with al thy besinesse.'

               `Ye, through the might of god!' quod Troilus.
               And Pandarus gan him the lettre take,
               And seyde, `Pardee, god hath holpen us;
               Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.'       1320
               But ofte gan the herte glade and quake
               Of Troilus, whyl that he gan it rede,
               So as the wordes yave him hope or drede.

               But fynally, he took al for the beste
               That she him wroot, for somwhat he biheld            1325
               On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste,
               Al covered she the wordes under sheld.
               Thus to the more worthy part he held,
               That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste,
               His grete wo for-yede he at the leste.               1330

               But as we may alday our-selven see,
               Through more wode or col, the more fyr;
               Right so encrees hope, of what it be,
               Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desyr;
               Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spyr,                1335
               So through this lettre, which that she him sente,
               Encresen gan desyr, of which he brente.

               Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night
               This Troilus gan to desiren more
               Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might   1340
               To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore,
               And wryten to hir of his sorwes sore
               Fro day to day; he leet it not refreyde,
               That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde;

               And dide also his othere observaunces                1345
               That to a lovere longeth in this cas;
               And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces,
               So was he outher glad or seyde `Allas!'
               And held after his gestes ay his pas;
               And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde,               1350
               So were his dayes sory outher gladde.

               But to Pandare alwey was his recours,
               And pitously gan ay til him to pleyne,
               And him bisoughte of rede and som socours;
               And Pandarus, that sey his wode peyne,               1355
               Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne,
               And bisily with al his herte caste
               Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste;

               And seyde, `Lord, and freend, and brother dere,
               God woot that thy disese dooth me wo.                1360
               But woltow stinten al this woful chere,
               And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two,
               And god to-forn, yet shal I shape it so,
               That thou shalt come in-to a certayn place,
               Ther-as thou mayst thy-self hir preye of grace.      1365

               `And certainly, I noot if thou it wost,
               But tho that been expert in love it seye,
               It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most,
               A man to have a leyser for to preye,
               And siker place his wo for to biwreye;               1370
               For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse,
               To here and see the giltles in distresse.

               `Paraunter thenkestow: though it be so

               `Thenk here-ayeins, whan that the sturdy ook,        1380

               `But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest,

               Al nere it but for man I love most,                  1410
               My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore
               It is; for sith that day that I was bore,
               I nas, ne never-mo to been I thinke,
               Ayeins a thing that mighte thee for-thinke.'

               Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seyde,            1415
               `Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun,
               That is my nece, and called is Criseyde,
               Which some men wolden doon oppressioun,
               And wrongfully have hir possessioun:
               Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche               1420
               To been our freend, with-oute more speche.'

               Deiphebus him answerde, `O, is not this,
               That thow spekest of to me thus straungely,
               Criseyda, my freend?' He seyde, `Yis.'
               `Than nedeth,' quod Deiphebus, `hardely,             1425

               Wol be hir champioun with spore and yerde;
               I roughte nought though alle hir foos it herde.

               `But tel me how, thou that woost al this matere,
               How I might best avaylen? Now lat see.'              1430
               Quod Pandarus; `If ye, my lord so dere,
               Wolden as now don this honour to me,
               To preyen hir to-morwe, lo, that she
               Come un-to yow hir pleyntes to devyse,
               Hir adversaries wolde of it agryse.                  1435

               `And if I more dorste preye as now,

               What with hir othere freendes governaunce.'

               Deiphebus, which that comen was, of kinde,
               To al honour and bountee to consente,
               Answerde, `It shal be doon; and I can finde          1445
               Yet gretter help to this in myn entente.
               What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleyne sente
               To speke of this? I trowe it be the beste;
               For she may leden Paris as hir leste.

               `Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother,        1450
               It nedeth nought to preye him freend to be;
               For I have herd him, o tyme and eek other,

               May seyn no bet, swich hap to him hath she.
               It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave;            1455
               He shal be swich, right as we wole him have.

               `Spek thou thy-self also to Troilus
               On my bihalve, and pray him with us dyne.'
               `Sire, al this shal be doon,' quod Pandarus;
               And took his leve, and never gan to fyne,            1460
               But to his neces hous, as streyt as lyne,
               He com; and fond hir fro the mete aryse;
               And sette him doun, and spak right in this wyse.

               He seyde, `O veray god, so have I ronne!
               Lo, nece myn, see ye nought how I swete?             1465
               I noot whether ye the more thank me conne.
               Be ye nought war how that fals Poliphete
               Is now aboute eft-sones for to plete,
               And bringe on yow advocacyes newe?'
               `I? No,' quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe.         1470

               `What is he more aboute, me to drecche
               And doon me wrong? What shal I do, allas?
               Yet of him-self no-thing ne wolde I recche,
               Nere it for Antenor and Eneas,
               That been his freendes in swich maner cas;           1475
               But, for the love of god, myn uncle dere,
               No fors of that; lat him have al y-fere;

               `With-outen that I have ynough for us.'
               `Nay,' quod Pandare, `it shal no-thing be so.
               For I have been right now at Deiphebus,              1480
               And Ector, and myne othere lordes mo,
               And shortly maked eche of hem his fo;
               That, by my thrift, he shal it never winne
               For ought he can, whan that so he biginne.'

               And as they casten what was best to done,            1485
               Deiphebus, of his owene curtasye,
               Com hir to preye, in his propre persone,
               To holde him on the morwe companye
               At diner, which she nolde not denye,
               But goodly gan to his preyere obeye.                 1490
               He thonked hir, and wente up-on his weye.

               Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up a-noon,
               To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende
               To Troilus, as stille as any stoon;
               And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende;       1495
               And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende;
               And seyde him, `Now is tyme, if that thou conne,
               To bere thee wel to-morwe, and al is wonne.

               `Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleyne;
               Lat not for nyce shame, or drede, or slouthe;        1500
               Som-tyme a man mot telle his owene peyne;
               Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe;
               Thou shalt be saved by thy feyth, in trouthe.
               But wel wot I, thou art now in a drede;
               And what it is, I leye, I can arede.                 1505

               `Thow thinkest now, "How sholde I doon al this?
               For by my cheres mosten folk aspye,
               That for hir love is that I fare a-mis;
               Yet hadde I lever unwist for sorwe dye."
               Now thenk not so, for thou dost greet folye.         1510
               For I right now have founden o manere
               Of sleighte, for to coveren al thy chere.

               `Thow shalt gon over night, and that as blyve,
               Un-to Deiphebus hous, as thee to pleye,
               Thy maladye a-wey the bet to dryve,                  1515
               For-why thou semest syk, soth for to seye.
               Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye,
               And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure,
               And ly right there, and byde thyn aventure.

               `Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take         1520
               The same tyme, and lasten til a-morwe;
               And lat see now how wel thou canst it make,
               For, par-dee, syk is he that is in sorwe.
               Go now, farwel! And, Venus here to borwe,
               I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme,            1525
               Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.'

               Quod Troilus, `Y-wis, thou nedelees
               Conseylest me, that sykliche I me feyne,
               For I am syk in ernest, doutelees,
               So that wel neigh I sterve for the peyne.'           1530
               Quod Pandarus, `Thou shalt the bettre pleyne,
               And hast the lasse need to countrefete;
               For him men demen hoot that men seen swete.

               `Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I
               Shal wel the deer un-to thy bowe dryve.'             1535
               Therwith he took his leve al softely,
               And Troilus to paleys wente blyve.
               So glad ne was he never in al his lyve;
               And to Pandarus reed gan al assente,
               And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente.             1540

               What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere
               That Deiphebus un-to his brother made,
               Or his accesse, or his siklych manere,
               How men gan him with clothes for to lade,
               Whan he was leyd, and how men wolde him glade?       1545
               But al for nought; he held forth ay the wyse
               That ye han herd Pandare er this devyse.

               But certeyn is, er Troilus him leyde,
               Deiphebus had him prayed, over night,
               To been a freend and helping to Criseyde.            1550
               God woot, that he it grauntede anon-right,
               To been hir fulle freend with al his might.
               But swich a nede was to preye him thenne,
               As for to bidde a wood man for to renne.

               The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme             1555
               Of meel-tyd, that the faire quene Eleyne
               Shoop hir to been, an houre after the pryme,
               With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne;
               But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne,
               She com to diner in hir playn entente.               1560
               But god and Pandare wiste al what this mente.

               Com eek Criseyde, al innocent of this,
               Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also;
               But flee we now prolixitee best is,
               For love of god, and lat us faste go                 1565
               Right to the effect, with-oute tales mo,
               Why al this folk assembled in this place;
               And lat us of hir saluinges pace.

               Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn,
               And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke.          1570
               But ever-more, `Allas!' was his refreyn,
               `My goode brother Troilus, the syke,
               Lyth yet"--and therwith-al he gan to syke;
               And after that, he peyned him to glade
               Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made.            1575

               Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse
               So feithfully, that pitee was to here,
               And every wight gan waxen for accesse
               A leche anoon, and seyde, `In this manere
               Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.'         1580
               But ther sat oon, al list hir nought to teche,
               That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche.

               After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse,
               As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne
               To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse          1585
               A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne: --
               `He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.'
               And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,
               He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme.

               Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough,            1590
               And every word gan for to notifye;
               For which with sobre chere hir herte lough;
               For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye,
               To mowen swich a knight don live or dye?
               But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;             1595
               For for o fyn is al that ever I telle.

               The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse,
               And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon,
               And gonne a while of this and that devyse.
               But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon,              1600
               And seyde to Deiphebus, `Wole ye goon,
               If youre wille be, as I yow preyde,
               To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?'

               Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held,
               Took first the tale, and seyde, `Go we blyve;'       1605
               And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,
               And seyde, `Ioves lat him never thryve,
               That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve!
               And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,
               If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.'              1610

               `Tel thou thy neces cas,' quod Deiphebus
               To Pandarus, `for thou canst best it telle.' --
               `My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus;
               What sholde I lenger,' quod he, `do yow dwelle?'
               He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle,                1615
               Up-on hir fo, that highte Poliphete,
               So heynous, that men mighte on it spete.

               Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other,
               And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien,
               `An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother;         1620
               And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.'
               What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien?
               Pleynly, alle at ones, they hir highten
               To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten.

               Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, `Pandarus,              1625
               Woot ought my lord, my brother, this matere,
               I mene, Ector? Or woot it Troilus?'
               He seyde, `Ye, but wole ye now me here?
               Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here,
               It were good, if that ye wolde assente,              1630
               She tolde hir-self him al this, er she wente.

               `For he wole have the more hir grief at herte,
               By cause, lo, that she a lady is;
               And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte,
               And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis,              1635
               If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.'
               And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere,
               `God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!'

               To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,
               And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge,                   1640
               Out wente anoon to Eleyne and Deiphebus,
               And seyde hem, `So there be no taryinge,
               Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe
               Criseyda, my lady, that is here;
               And as he may enduren, he wole here.                 1645

               `But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte,
               And fewe folk may lightly make it warm;
               Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte,
               To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm
               Or him disesen, for my bettre arm),                  1650
               Wher it be bet she byde til eft-sones;

               Reherce hir cas unlyk that she can seye;
               And after this, she may him ones preye
               To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve;
               This may not muchel of his ese him reve.

               `And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere        1660
               His ese, which that him thar nought for yow;
               Eek other thing that toucheth not to here,

               And they, that no-thing knewe of his entente,        1665

               Eleyne, in al hir goodly softe wyse,
               Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye,
               And seyde, `Ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse!

               As she best coude, she gan him to disporte.

               So after this quod she, `We yow biseke,

               Un-to Criseyde, which that certeinly
               Receyveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare,

               This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affyle,

               `Good thrift have ye,' quod Eleyne the quene.

               Quod Pandarus, `And it your wille be
               That she may take hir leve, er that she go?'

               `If that she vouche sauf for to do so.'
               And with that word quod Troilus, `Ye two,

               Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde

               And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde,

               Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon
               To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prye                 1710
               That al was wel, and out he gan to goon
               In-to the grete chambre, and that in hye,
               And seyde, `God save al this companye!

               `But he that goth, for gold or for richesse,          400
               On swich message, calle him what thee list;
               And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,
               Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;
               Departe it so, for wyde-where is wist
               How that there is dyversitee requered                 405
               Bitwixen thinges lyke, as I have lered.

               `And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene
               That this servyse a shame be or Iape,
               I have my faire suster Polixene,
               Cassandre, Eleyne, or any of the frape;               410
               Be she never so faire or wel y-shape,
               Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,
               To han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone.

               `But, sith that thou hast don me this servyse
               My lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede,            415
               So, for the love of god, this grete empryse
               Performe it out; for now is moste nede.
               For high and low, with-outen any drede,
               I wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe;
               Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.'         420

               Thus held him ech of other wel apayed,
               That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;
               And, on the morwe, whan they were arayed,
               Ech to his owene nedes gan entende.
               But Troilus, though as the fyr he brende              425
               For sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce,
               He not for-gat his gode governaunce.

               But in him-self with manhod gan restreyne
               Ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere,
               That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,             430
               Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,
               What that he mente, as touching this matere.
               From every wight as fer as is the cloude
               He was, so wel dissimulen he coude.

               And al the whyl which that I yow devyse,              435
               This was his lyf; with al his fulle might,
               By day he was in Martes high servyse,
               This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;
               And for the more part, the longe night
               He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve         440
               His lady best, hir thank for to deserve.

               Nil I nought swere, al-though he lay softe,
               That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,
               Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte,
               And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;           445
               But in swich cas men is nought alwey plesed,
               For ought I wot, no more than was he;
               That can I deme of possibilitee.

               But certeyn is, to purpos for to go,
               That in this whyle, as writen is in geste,            450
               He say his lady som-tyme; and also
               She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste,
               And by hir bothe avys, as was the beste,
               Apoynteden ful warly in this nede,
               So as they dorste, how they wolde procede.            455

               But it was spoken in so short a wyse,
               In swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere,
               Lest any wyght devynen or devyse
               Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,
               That al this world so leef to hem ne were             460
               As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende
               To maken of hir speche aright an ende.

               But thilke litel that they spake or wroughte,
               His wyse goost took ay of al swich hede,
               It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte              465
               With-outen word, so that it was no nede
               To bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede;
               For which she thought that love, al come it late,
               Of alle Ioye hadde opned hir the yate.

               And shortly of this proces for to pace,               470
               So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,
               That he so ful stood in his lady grace,
               That twenty thousand tymes, or she lette,
               She thonked god she ever with him mette;
               So coude he him governe in swich servyse,             475
               That al the world ne might it bet devyse.

               For-why she fond him so discreet in al,
               So secret, and of swich obeisaunce,
               That wel she felte he was to hir a wal
               Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;          480
               That, to ben in his gode governaunce,
               So wys he was, she was no more afered,
               I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered.

               And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr,
               Was evere y-lyke prest and diligent;                  485
               To ese his frend was set al his desyr.
               He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;
               He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent.
               That never man, as in his freendes nede,
               Ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede.             490

               But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde
               That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere
               Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde,
               In al this whyle un-to his lady dere;
               I trowe it were a long thing for to here;             495
               Or of what wight that stant in swich disioynte,
               His wordes alle, or every look, to poynte.

               For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this,
               In storye noon, ne no man here, I wene;
               And though I wolde I coude not, y-wis;                500
               For ther was som epistel hem bitwene,
               That wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene
               Neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte;
               How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endyte?

               But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,             505
               That stonding in concord and in quiete,
               Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,
               As I have told, and in this tyme swete,
               Save only often mighte they not mete,
               Ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle,               510
               That it befel right as I shal yow telle.

               That Pandarus, that ever dide his might
               Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here,
               As for to bringe to his hous som night
               His faire nece, and Troilus y-fere,                   515
               Wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere,
               Touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde,
               Hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde.

               For he with greet deliberacioun
               Hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle           520
               Forn-cast, and put in execucioun.
               And neither laft, for cost ne for travayle;
               Come if hem list, hem sholde no-thing fayle;
               And for to been in ought espyed there,
               That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were.               525

               Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind
               Of every pye and every lette-game;
               Now al is wel, for al the world is blind
               In this matere, bothe fremed and tame.
               This timbur is al redy up to frame;                   530
               Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde
               A certein houre, in which she comen sholde.

               And Troilus, that al this purveyaunce
               Knew at the fulle, and waytede on it ay,
               Hadde here-up-on eek made gret ordenaunce,            535
               And founde his cause, and ther-to his aray,
               If that he were missed, night or day,
               Ther-whyle he was aboute this servyse,
               That he was goon to doon his sacrifyse,

               And moste at swich a temple alone wake,               540
               Answered of Appollo for to be;
               And first to seen the holy laurer quake,
               Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,
               To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,
               And forthy lette him no man, god forbede,             545
               But preye Apollo helpen in this nede.

               Now is ther litel more for to doone,
               But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne,
               Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,
               Whan lightles is the world a night or tweyne,         550
               And that the welken shoop him for to reyne,
               He streight a-morwe un-to his nece wente;
               Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente.

               Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye
               As he was wont, and of him-self to Iape;              555
               And fynally, he swor and gan hir seye,
               By this and that, she sholde him not escape,
               Ne lengere doon him after hir to gape;
               But certeynly she moste, by hir leve,
               Come soupen in his hous with him at eve.              560

               At whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse,
               And seyde, `It rayneth; lo, how sholde I goon?'
               `Lat be,' quod he, `ne stond not thus to muse;
               This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.'
               So at the laste her-of they felle at oon,             565
               Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere,
               He nolde never come ther she were.

               Sone after this, to him she gan to rowne,
               And asked him if Troilus were there?
               He swor hir, `Nay, for he was out of towne,'          570
               And seyde, `Nece, I pose that he were,
               Yow thurfte never have the more fere.
               For rather than men mighte him ther aspye,
               Me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.'

               Nought list myn auctor fully to declare               575
               What that she thoughte whan he seyde so,
               That Troilus was out of town y-fare,
               As if he seyde ther-of sooth or no;
               But that, with-outen awayt, with him to go,
               She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte          580
               And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte.

               But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,
               Al-though with him to goon it was no fere,
               For to be war of goosish peples speche,
               That dremen thinges whiche that never were,           585
               And wel avyse him whom he broughte there;
               And seyde him, `Eem, sin I mot on yow triste,
               Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.'

               He swor hire, `Yis, by stokkes and by stones,
               And by the goddes that in hevene dwelle,              590
               Or elles were him levere, soule and bones,
               With Pluto king as depe been in helle
               As Tantalus!' What sholde I more telle?
               Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,
               And she to souper com, whan it was eve,               595

               With a certayn of hir owene men,
               And with hir faire nece Antigone,
               And othere of hir wommen nyne or ten;
               But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,
               But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see             600
               Thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe,
               Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe,

               Unwist of every wight but of Pandare?
               But to the poynt; now whan that she was y-come
               With alle Ioye, and alle frendes fare,                605
               Hir em anoon in armes hath hir nome,
               And after to the souper, alle and some,
               Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette;
               God wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette.

               And after souper gonnen they to ryse,                 610
               At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade,
               And wel was him that coude best devyse
               To lyken hir, or that hir laughen made.
               He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade.
               But at the laste, as every thing hath ende,           615
               She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende.

               But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes,
               O influences of thise hevenes hye!
               Soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes,
               Though to us bestes been the causes wrye.             620
               This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hye,
               But execut was al bisyde hir leve,
               At the goddes wil, for which she moste bleve.

               The bente mone with hir hornes pale,
               Saturne, and Iove, in Cancro ioyned were,             625
               That swich a rayn from hevene gan avale
               That every maner womman that was there
               Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere;
               At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne,
               `Now were it tyme a lady to go henne!                 630

               `But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese
               Yow any-thing, than prey I yow,' quod he,
               `To doon myn herte as now so greet an ese
               As for to dwelle here al this night with me,
               For-why this is your owene hous, pardee.              635
               For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game,
               To wende as now, it were to me a shame.'

               Criseyde, which that coude as muche good
               As half a world, tok hede of his preyere;
               And sin it ron, and al was on a flood,                640
               She thoughte, as good chep may I dwellen here,
               And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,
               And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde;
               For hoom to goon, it may nought wel bityde.'

               `I wol,' quod she, `myn uncle leef and dere,          645
               Sin that yow list, it skile is to be so;
               I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;
               I seyde but a-game, I wolde go.'
               `Y-wis, graunt mercy, nece!' quod he tho;
               `Were it a game or no, soth for to telle,             650
               Now am I glad, sin that yow list to dwelle.'

               Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright
               The newe Ioye, and al the feste agayn;
               But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,
               He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fayn,                  655
               And seyde, `Lord, this is an huge rayn!
               This were a weder for to slepen inne;
               And that I rede us sonE to biginne.

               `And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye,
               For that we shul not liggen fer asonder,              660
               And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye,
               Heren noise of reynes nor of thondre?
               By god, right in my lyte closet yonder.
               And I wol in that outer hous allone
               Be wardeyn of your wommen everichone.                 665

               `And in this middel chaumbre that ye see
               Shal youre wommen slepen wel and softe;
               And ther I seyde shal your-selve be;
               And if ye liggen wel to-night, com ofte,
               And careth not what weder is on-lofte.                670
               The wyn anon, and whan so that yow leste,
               So go we slepe, I trowe it be the beste.'

               Ther nis no more, but here-after sone,
               The voyde dronke, and travers drawe anon,
               Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done            675
               More in the place, out of the chaumber gon.
               And ever-mo so sternelich it ron,
               And blew ther-with so wonderliche loude,
               That wel neigh no man heren other coude.

               Tho Pandarus, hir eem, right as him oughte,           680
               With women swiche as were hir most aboute,
               Ful glad un-to hir beddes syde hir broughte,
               And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute,
               And seyde, `Here at this closet-dore with-oute,
               Right over-thwart, your wommen liggen alle,           685
               That, whom yow list of hem, ye may here calle.'

               So whan that she was in the closet leyd,
               And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce
               A-bedde weren, ther as I have seyd,
               There was no more to skippen nor to traunce,          690
               But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce,
               If any wight was steringe any-where,
               And late hem slepe that a-bedde were.

               But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del
               The olde daunce, and every poynt ther-inne,           695
               Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel,
               He thoughte he wolde up-on his werk biginne,
               And gan the stewe-dore al softe un-pinne;
               And stille as stoon, with-outen lenger lette,
               By Troilus a-doun right he him sette.                 700

               And, shortly to the poynt right for to gon,
               Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende,
               And seyde, `Make thee redy right anon,
               For thou shalt in-to hevene blisse wende.'
               `Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,'             705
               Quod Troilus, `for never yet no nede
               Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede.'

               Quod Pandarus, `Ne drede thee never a del,
               For it shal been right as thou wilt desyre;
               So thryve I, this night shal I make it wel,           710
               Or casten al the gruwel in the fyre.'
               `Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspyre,'
               Quod Troilus, `as wis as I thee serve,

               `O Iove eek, for the love of faire Europe,

               And with that word he gan un-do a trappe,
               And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe.

               The sterne wind so loude gan to route

               Another day, whan that I mighte him finde;
               But this thing stant al in another kinde.

               `This is so gentil and so tendre of herte,
               That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke;          905
               For trusteth wel, how sore that him smerte,
               He wol to yow no Ialouse wordes speke.
               And for-thy, nece, er that his herte breke,
               So spek your-self to him of this matere;
               For with o word ye may his herte stere.               910

               `Now have I told what peril he is inne,
               And his coming unwist is to every wight;
               Ne, pardee, harm may ther be noon, ne sinne;
               I wol my-self be with yow al this night.
               Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight,              915
               And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste,
               And I al prest to fecche him whan yow liste.'

               This accident so pitous was to here,
               And eek so lyk a sooth, at pryme face,
               And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere,                920
               His prive coming, and the siker place,
               That, though that she dide him as thanne a grace,
               Considered alle thinges as they stode,
               No wonder is, sin she dide al for gode.

               Cryseyde answerde, `As wisly god at reste             925
               My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo!
               And eem, y-wis, fayn wolde I doon the beste,
               If that I hadde grace to do so.
               But whether that ye dwelle or for him go,
               I am, til god me bettre minde sende,                  930
               At dulcarnon, right at my wittes ende.'

               Quod Pandarus, `Ye, nece, wol ye here?
               Dulcarnon called is "fleminge of wrecches";
               It semeth hard, for wrecches wol not lere
               For verray slouthe or othere wilful tecches;          935
               This seyd by hem that be not worth two fecches.
               But ye ben wys, and that we han on honde
               Nis neither hard, ne skilful to withstonde.'

               `Thanne, eem,' quod she, `doth her-of as yow list;
               But er he come, I wil up first aryse;                 940
               And, for the love of god, sin al my trist
               Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wyse,
               So wircheth now in so discreet a wyse,
               That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;
               For I am here al in your governaunce.'                945

               `That is wel seyd,' quod he, `my nece dere'
               Ther good thrift on that wyse gentil herte!
               But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here,
               It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte;
               And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte,             950
               For love of god; and, Venus, I the herie;
               For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.'

               This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette
               Ful sobrely, right be hir beddes heed,
               And in his beste wyse his lady grette;                955
               But lord, so she wex sodeynliche reed!
               Ne, though men sholden smyten of hir heed,
               She coude nought a word a-right out-bringe
               So sodeynly, for his sodeyn cominge.

               But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele                  960
               In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan,
               And seyde, `Nece, see how this lord can knele!
               Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!'
               And with that word he for a quisshen ran,
               And seyde, `Kneleth now, whyl that yow leste,         965
               Ther god your hertes bringe sone at reste!'

               Can I not seyn, for she bad him not ryse,
               If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,
               Or elles that she toke it in the wyse
               Of duetee, as for his observaunce;                    970
               But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce,
               That she him kiste, al-though she syked sore;
               And bad him sitte a-doun with-outen more.

               Quod Pandarus, `Now wol ye wel biginne;
               Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere,                   975
               Upon your beddes syde al there with-inne,
               That ech of yow the bet may other here.'
               And with that word he drow him to the fere,
               And took a light, and fond his contenaunce,
               As for to loke up-on an old romaunce.                 980

               Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right,
               And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse,
               Al thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight
               Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse,
               Yet nathelees, considered his distresse,              985
               And that love is in cause of swich folye,
               Thus to him spak she of his Ialousye:

               `Lo, herte myn, as wolde the excellence
               Of love, ayeins the which that no man may,
               Ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence                 990
               And eek bycause I felte wel and say
               Youre grete trouthe, and servyse every day;
               And that your herte al myn was, sooth to seyne,
               This droof me for to rewe up-on your peyne.

               `And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit,          995
               Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight,
               I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit,
               Al can I nought as muche as it were right;
               And I, emforth my conninge and my might,
               Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte,           1000
               Ben to yow trewe and hool, with a myn herte;

               `And dredelees, that shal be founde at preve. --
               But, herte myn, what al this is to seyne
               Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve,
               Though I to yow right on your-self compleyne.        1005
               For ther-with mene I fynally the peyne,
               That halt your herte and myn in hevinesse,
               Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.

               `My goode, myn, not I for-why ne how
               That Ialousye, allas! That wikked wivere,            1010
               Thus causelees is cropen in-to yow;
               The harm of which I wolde fayn delivere!
               Allas! That he, al hool, or of him slivere,
               Shuld have his refut in so digne a place,
               Ther Iove him sone out of your herte arace!          1015

               `But O, thou Iove, O auctor of nature,
               Is this an honour to thy deitee,
               That folk ungiltif suffren here iniure,
               And who that giltif is, al quit goth he?
               O were it leful for to pleyne on thee,               1020
               That undeserved suffrest Ialousye,
               Of that I wolde up-on thee pleyne and crye!

               `Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen
               To seyn right thus, "Ye, Ialousye is love!"
               And wolde a busshel venim al excusen,                1025
               For that o greyn of love is on it shove!
               But that wot heighe god that sit above,
               If it be lyker love, or hate, or grame;
               And after that, it oughte bere his name.

               `But certeyn is, som maner Ialousye                  1030
               Is excusable more than som, y-wis.
               As whan cause is, and som swich fantasye
               With pietee so wel repressed is,
               That it unnethe dooth or seyth amis,
               But goodly drinketh up al his distresse;             1035
               And that excuse I, for the gentilesse.

               `And som so ful of furie is and despyt
               That it sourmounteth his repressioun;
               But herte myn, ye be not in that plyt,
               That thanke I god, for whiche your passioun          1040
               I wol not calle it but illusioun,
               Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure,
               That dooth your herte this disese endure.

               `Of which I am right sory but not wrooth;
               But, for my devoir and your hertes reste,            1045
               Wher-so yow list, by ordal or by ooth,
               By sort, or in what wyse so yow leste,
               For love of god, lat preve it for the beste!
               And if that I be giltif, do me deye,
               Allas! What mighte I more doon or seye?'             1050

               With that a fewe brighte teres newe
               Owt of hir eyen fille, and thus she seyde,
               `Now god, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe
               To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.'
               With that hir heed doun in the bed she leyde,        1055
               And with the shete it wreigh, and syghed sore,
               And held hir pees; not o word spak she more.

               But now help god to quenchen al this sorwe,
               So hope I that he shal, for he best may;
               For I have seyn, of a ful misty morwe                1060
               Folwen ful ofte a mery someres day;
               And after winter folweth grene May.
               Men seen alday, and reden eek in stories,
               That after sharpe shoures been victories.

               This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde,              1065
               Have ye no care, him liste not to slepe;
               For it thoughte him no strokes of a yerde
               To here or seen Criseyde, his lady wepe;
               But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe,
               For every teer which that Criseyde asterte,          1070
               The crampe of deeth, to streyne him by the herte.

               And in his minde he gan the tyme acurse
               That he cam there, and that that he was born;
               For now is wikke y-turned in-to worse,
               And al that labour he hath doon biforn,              1075
               He wende it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn.
               `O Pandarus,' thoughte he, `allas! Thy wyle
               Serveth of nought, so weylaway the whyle!'

               And therwithal he heng a-doun the heed,
               And fil on knees, and sorwfully he sighte;           1080
               What mighte he seyn? He felte he nas but deed,
               For wrooth was she that shulde his sorwes lighte.
               But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte,
               Than seyde he thus, `God woot, that of this game,
               Whan al is wist, than am I not to blame!'            1085

               Ther-with the sorwe so his herte shette,
               That from his eyen fil there not a tere,
               And every spirit his vigour in-knette,
               So they astoned or oppressed were.
               The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere,             1090
               Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne;
               And doun he fel al sodeynly a-swowne.

               This was no litel sorwe for to see;
               But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste,
               `O nece, pees, or we be lost,' quod he,              1095
               `Beth nought agast;' But certeyn, at the laste,
               For this or that, he in-to bedde him caste,
               And seyde, `O theef, is this a mannes herte?'
               And of he rente al to his bare sherte;

               And seyde, `Nece, but ye helpe us now,               1100
               Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!'
               `Y-wis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,
               Ful fayn,' quod she; `Allas! That I was born!'
               `Ye, nece, wole ye pullen out the thorn
               That stiketh in his herte?' quod Pandare;            1105
               `Sey "Al foryeve," and stint is al this fare!'

               `Ye, that to me,' quod she, `ful lever were
               Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth';
               And therwith-al she swoor him in his ere,
               `Y-wis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth,           1110
               Have here my trouthe and many another ooth;
               Now speek to me, for it am I, Cryseyde!'
               But al for nought; yet mighte he not a-breyde.

               Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes
               They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweyne,      1115
               And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes,
               She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,
               Him to revoken she dide al hir peyne.
               And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,
               And of his swough sone after that adawe,             1120

               And gan bet minde and reson to him take,
               But wonder sore he was abayst, y-wis.
               And with a syk, whan he gan bet a-wake,
               He seyde, `O mercy, god, what thing is this?'
               `Why do ye with your-selven thus amis?'              1125
               Quod tho Criseyde, `Is this a mannes game?
               What, Troilus! Wol ye do thus, for shame?'

               And therwith-al hir arm over him she leyde,
               And al foryaf, and ofte tyme him keste.
               He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seyde           1130
               As fil to purpos for his herte reste.
               And she to that answerde him as hir leste;
               And with hir goodly wordes him disporte
               She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.

               Quod Pandarus, `For ought I can espyen,              1135
               This light, nor I ne serven here of nought;
               Light is not good for syke folkes yen.
               But for the love of god, sin ye be brought
               In thus good plyt, lat now non hevy thought
               Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweye:'            1140
               And bar the candele to the chimeneye.

               Sone after this, though it no nede were,
               Whan she swich othes as hir list devyse
               Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere,
               Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes ryse.         1145
               Yet lesse thing than othes may suffyse
               In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse,
               That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse.

               But in effect she wolde wite anoon
               Of what man, and eek where, and also why             1150
               He Ielous was, sin ther was cause noon;
               And eek the signe, that he took it by,
               She bad him that to telle hir bisily,
               Or elles, certeyn, she bar him on honde,
               That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.           1155

               With-outen more, shortly for to seyne,
               He moste obeye un-to his lady heste;
               And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne.
               He seyde hir, whan she was at swiche a feste,
               She mighte on him han loked at the leste;            1160
               Not I not what, al dere y-nough a risshe,
               As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe.

               And she answerde, `Swete, al were it so,
               What harm was that, sin I non yvel mene?
               For, by that god that boughte us bothe two,          1165
               In alle thinge is myn entente clene.
               Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;
               Wol ye the childish Ialous contrefete?
               Now were it worthy that ye were y-bete.'

               Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to syke,                   1170
               Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deyde;
               And seyde, `Allas! Up-on my sorwes syke
               Have mercy, swete herte myn, Cryseyde!
               And if that, in tho wordes that I seyde,
               Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;                1175
               Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.'

               And she answerde, `Of gilt misericorde!
               That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;
               And ever-more on this night yow recorde,
               And beth wel war ye do no more amis.'                1180
               `Nay, dere herte myn,' quod he, `y-wis.'
               `And now,' quod she, `that I have do yow smerte,
               Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte.'

               This Troilus, with blisse of that supprysed,
               Put al in goddes hond, as he that mente              1185
               No-thing but wel; and, sodeynly avysed,
               He hir in armes faste to him hente.
               And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,
               Leyde him to slepe, and seyde, `If ye ben wyse,
               Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.'             1190

               What mighte or may the sely larke seye,
               Whan that the sperhauk hath it in his foot?
               I can no more, but of thise ilke tweye,
               To whom this tale sucre be or soot,
               Though that I tarie a yeer, som-tyme I moot,         1195
               After myn auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,
               As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.

               Criseyde, which that felte hir thus y-take,
               As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,
               Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake,             1200
               Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.
               But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,
               Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;
               Thus sondry peynes bringen folk in hevene.

               This Troilus in armes gan hir streyne,               1205
               And seyde, `O swete, as ever mote I goon,
               Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweyne;
               Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.'
               To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,
               `Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere,             1210
               Ben yolde, y-wis, I were now not here!'

               O! Sooth is seyd, that heled for to be
               As of a fevre or othere greet syknesse,
               Men moste drinke, as men may often see,
               Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse,          1215
               Men drinken often peyne and greet distresse;
               I mene it here, as for this aventure,
               That thourgh a peyne hath founden al his cure.

               And now swetnesse semeth more sweet,
               That bitternesse assayed was biforn;                 1220
               For out of wo in blisse now they flete;
               Non swich they felten, sith they were born;
               Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn!
               For love of god, take every womman hede
               To werken thus, if it comth to the nede.             1225

               Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene,
               As she that iuste cause hadde him to triste,
               Made him swich feste, it Ioye was to sene,
               Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste.
               And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste,            1230
               Bitrent and wryth the sote wode-binde,
               Gan eche of hem in armes other winde.

               And as the newe abaysshed nightingale,
               That stinteth first whan she biginneth to singe,
               Whan that she hereth any herde tale,                 1235
               Or in the hegges any wight steringe,
               And after siker dooth hir voys out-ringe;
               Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,
               Opned hir herte and tolde him hir entente.

               And right as he that seeth his deeth y-shapen,       1240
               And deye moot, in ought that he may gesse,
               And sodeynly rescous doth him escapen,
               And from his deeth is brought in sikernesse,
               For al this world, in swich present gladnesse
               Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete;                1245
               With worse hap god lat us never mete!

               Hir armes smale, hir streyghte bak and softe,
               Hir sydes longe, fleshly, smothe, and whyte
               He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte
               Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lyte;     1250
               Thus in this hevene he gan him to delyte,
               And ther-with-al a thousand tyme hir kiste;
               That, what to done, for Ioye unnethe he wiste.

               Than seyde he thus, `O, Love, O, Charitee,
               Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete,                   1255
               After thy-self next heried be she,
               Venus mene I, the wel-willy planete;
               And next that, Imeneus, I thee grete;
               For never man was to yow goddes holde
               As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.          1260

               `Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges,
               Who-so wol grace, and list thee nought honouren,
               Lo, his desyr wol flee with-outen winges.
               For, noldestow of bountee hem socouren
               That serven best and most alwey labouren,            1265
               Yet were al lost, that dar I wel seyn, certes,
               But-if thy grace passed our desertes.

               `And for thou me, that coude leest deserve
               Of hem that nombred been un-to thy grace,
               Hast holpen, ther I lykly was to sterve,             1270
               And me bistowed in so heygh a place
               That thilke boundes may no blisse pace,
               I can no more, but laude and reverence
               Be to thy bounte and thyn excellence!'

               And therwith-al Criseyde anoon he kiste,             1275
               Of which, certeyn, she felte no disese,
               And thus seyde he, `Now wolde god I wiste,
               Myn herte swete, how I yow mighte plese!
               What man,' quod he, `was ever thus at ese
               As I, on whiche the faireste and the beste           1280
               That ever I say, deyneth hir herte reste.

               `Here may men seen that mercy passeth right;
               The experience of that is felt in me,
               That am unworthy to so swete a wight.
               But herte myn, of your benignitee,                   1285
               So thenketh, though that I unworthy be,
               Yet mot I nede amenden in som wyse,
               Right thourgh the vertu of your heyghe servyse.

               `And for the love of god, my lady dere,
               Sin god hath wrought me for I shal yow serve,        1290
               As thus I mene, that ye wol be my stere,
               To do me live, if that yow liste, or sterve,
               So techeth me how that I may deserve
               Your thank, so that I, thurgh myn ignoraunce,
               Ne do no-thing that yow be displesaunce.             1295

               `For certes, fresshe wommanliche wyf,
               This dar I seye, that trouthe and diligence,
               That shal ye finden in me al my lyf,
               Ne wol not, certeyn, breken your defence;
               And if I do, present or in absence,                  1300
               For love of god, lat slee me with the dede,
               If that it lyke un-to your womanhede.'

               `Y-wis,' quod she, `myn owne hertes list,
               My ground of ese, and al myn herte dere,
               Graunt mercy, for on that is al my trist;            1305
               But late us falle awey fro this matere;
               For it suffyseth, this that seyd is here.
               And at o word, with-outen repentaunce,
               Wel-come, my knight, my pees, my suffisaunce!'

               Of hir delyt, or Ioyes oon the leste                 1310
               Were impossible to my wit to seye;
               But iuggeth, ye that han ben at the feste,
               Of swich gladnesse, if that hem liste pleye!
               I can no more, but thus thise ilke tweye
               That night, be-twixen dreed and sikernesse,          1315
               Felten in love the grete worthinesse.

               O blisful night, of hem so longe y-sought,
               How blithe un-to hem bothe two thou were!
               Why ne hadde I swich on with my soule y-bought,
               Ye, or the leeste Ioye that was there?               1320
               A-wey, thou foule daunger and thou fere,
               And lat hem in this hevene blisse dwelle,
               That is so heygh, that al ne can I telle!

               But sooth is, though I can not tellen al,
               As can myn auctor, of his excellence,                1325
               Yet have I seyd, and, god to-forn, I shal
               In every thing al hoolly his sentence.
               And if that I, at loves reverence,
               Have any word in eched for the beste,
               Doth therwith-al right as your-selven leste.         1330

               For myne wordes, here and every part,
               I speke hem alle under correccioun
               Of yow, that feling han in loves art,
               And putte it al in your discrecioun
               To encrese or maken diminucioun                      1335
               Of my langage, and that I yow bi-seche;
               But now to purpos of my rather speche.

               Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft,
               So looth to hem a-sonder goon it were,
               That ech from other wende been biraft,               1340
               Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere,
               That al this thing but nyce dremes were;
               For which ful ofte ech of hem seyde, `O swete,
               Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?'

               And, lord! So he gan goodly on hir see,              1345
               That never his look ne bleynte from hir face,
               And seyde, `O dere herte, may it be
               That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?'
               `Ye, herte myn, god thank I of his grace!'
               Quod tho Criseyde, and therwith-al him kiste,        1350
               That where his spirit was, for Ioye he niste.

               This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two
               Gan for to kisse, and seyde, `O eyen clere,
               It were ye that wroughte me swich wo,
               Ye humble nettes of my lady dere!                    1355
               Though ther be mercy writen in your chere,
               God wot, the text ful hard is, sooth, to finde,
               How coude ye with-outen bond me binde?'

               Therwith he gan hir faste in armes take,
               And wel an hundred tymes gan he syke,                1360
               Nought swiche sorwfull sykes as men make
               For wo, or elles whan that folk ben syke,
               But esy sykes, swiche as been to lyke,
               That shewed his affeccioun with-inne;
               Of swiche sykes coude he nought bilinne.             1365

               Sone after this they speke of sondry thinges,
               As fil to purpos of this aventure,
               And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes,
               Of which I can nought tellen no scripture;
               But wel I woot, a broche, gold and asure,            1370
               In whiche a ruby set was lyk an herte,
               Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte.

               Lord! trowe ye, a coveitous, a wreccbe,
               That blameth love and holt of it despyt,
               That, of tho pens that he can mokre and kecche,      1375
               Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delyt,
               As is in love, in oo poynt, in som plyt?
               Nay, doutelees, for also god me save,
               So parfit Ioye may no nigard have!

               They wol sey `Yis,' but lord! So that they lye,      1380
               Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede!
               They callen love a woodnesse or folye,
               But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede;
               They shul forgo the whyte and eke the rede,
               And live in wo, ther god yeve hem mischaunce,        1385
               And every lover in his trouthe avaunce!

               As wolde god, tho wrecches, that dispyse
               Servyse of love, hadde eres al-so longe
               As hadde Myda, ful of coveityse,
               And ther-to dronken hadde as hoot and stronge        1390
               As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge,
               To techen hem that they ben in the vyce,
               And loveres nought, al-though they holde hem nyce!

               Thise ilke two, of whom that I yow seye,
               Whan that hir hertes wel assured were,               1395
               Tho gonne they to speken and to pleye,
               And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where,
               They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere
               That passed was; but al swich hevinesse,
               I thanke it god, was tourned to gladnesse.           1400

               And ever-mo, whan that hem fel to speke
               Of any thing of swich a tyme agoon,
               With kissing al that tale sholde breke,
               And fallen in a newe Ioye anoon,
               And diden al hir might, sin they were oon,           1405
               For to recoveren blisse and been at ese,
               And passed wo with Ioye countrepeyse.

               Reson wil not that I speke of sleep,
               For it accordeth nought to my matere;
               God woot, they toke of that ful litel keep,          1410
               But lest this night, that was to hem so dere,
               Ne sholde in veyn escape in no manere,
               It was biset in Ioye and bisinesse
               Of al that souneth in-to gentilnesse.

               But whan the cok, comune astrologer,                 1415
               Gan on his brest to bete, and after crowe,
               And Lucifer, the dayes messager,

               With herte sore, to Troilus thus seyde: --

               `Myn hertes lyf, my trist and my plesaunce,
               That I was born, allas! What me is wo,
               That day of us mot make desseveraunce!
               For tyme it is to ryse, and hennes go,               1425
               Or elles I am lost for evermo!
               O night, allas! Why niltow over us hove,

               `O blake night, as folk in bokes rede,

               This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte,
               As thoughte him tho, for pietous distresse,
               The blody teres from his herte melte,                1445
               As he that never yet swich hevinesse
               Assayed hadde, out of so greet gladnesse,
               Gan therwith-al Criseyde his lady dere
               In armes streyne, and seyde in this manere: --

               `O cruel day, accusour of the Ioye                   1450
               That night and love han stole and faste y-wryen,
               A-cursed be thy coming in-to Troye,
               For every bore hath oon of thy bright yen!
               Envyous day, what list thee so to spyen?
               What hastow lost, why sekestow this place,           1455
               Ther god thy lyght so quenche, for his grace?

               `Allas! What han thise loveres thee agilt,
               Dispitous day? Thyn be the pyne of helle!
               For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt;
               Thy pouring in wol no-wher lete hem dwelle.          1460
               What proferestow thy light here for to selle?
               Go selle it hem that smale seles graven,
               We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.'

               And eek the sonne Tytan gan he chyde,
               And seyde, `O fool, wel may men thee dispyse,        1465
               That hast the Dawing al night by thy syde,
               And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee ryse,
               For to disesen loveres in this wyse.
               What! Holde your bed ther, thou, and eek thy Morwe!
               I bidde god, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!'               1470

               Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seyde,
               `My lady right, and of my wele or wo

               For how sholde I my lyf an houre save,
               Sin that with yow is al the lyf I have?

               `What shal I doon, for certes, I not how,

               And of my lyf, god woot, how that shal be,
               Sin that desyr right now so byteth me,
               That I am deed anoon, but I retourne.
               How sholde I longe, allas! Fro yow soiourne?

               `But nathelees, myn owene lady bright,               1485
               Yit were it so that I wiste outrely,
               That I, your humble servaunt and your knight,
               Were in your herte set so fermely
               As ye in myn, the which thing, trewely,
               Me lever were than thise worldes tweyne,             1490
               Yet sholde I bet enduren al my peyne.'

               To that Cryseyde answerde right anoon,
               And with a syk she seyde, `O herte dere,
               The game, y-wis, so ferforth now is goon,
               That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere,          1495
               And every egle been the dowves fere,
               And every roche out of his place sterte,
               Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte!

               `Ye he so depe in-with myn herte grave,
               That, though I wolde it turne out of my thought,     1500
               As wisly verray god my soule save,
               To dyen in the peyne, I coude nought!
               And, for the love of god that us bath wrought,
               Lat in your brayn non other fantasye
               So crepe, that it cause me to dye!                   1505

               `And that ye me wolde han as faste in minde
               As I have yow, that wolde I yow bi-seche;
               And, if I wiste soothly that to finde,
               God mighte not a poynt my Ioyes eche!
               But, herte myn, with-oute more speche,               1510

               `Beth glad for-thy, and live in sikernesse;
               Thus seyde I never er this, ne shal to mo;
               And if to yow it were a gret gladnesse               1515
               To turne ayein, soone after that ye go,
               As fayn wolde I as ye, it were so,
               As wisly god myn herte bringe at reste!'
               And him in armes took, and ofte keste.

               Agayns his wil, sin it mot nedes be,                 1520
               This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,
               And in his armes took his lady free
               An hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde,
               And with swich wordes as his herte bledde,
               He seyde, `Farewel, mr dere herte swete,             1525
               Ther god us graunte sounde and sone to mete!'

               To which no word for sorwe she answerde,
               So sore gan his parting hir destreyne;
               And Troilus un-to his palays ferde,
               As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne;             1530
               So hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne
               For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce,
               That it may never out of his remembraunce.

               Retorned to his real palais, sone
               He softe in-to his bed gan for to slinke,            1535
               To slepe longe, as he was wont to done,
               But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke,
               But sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke;
               Thenkinge how she, for whom desyr him brende,
               A thousand-fold was worth more than he wende.        1540

               And in his thought gan up and doun to winde
               Hir wordes alle, and every countenaunce,
               And fermely impressen in his minde
               The leste poynt that to him was plesaunce;
               And verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce,             1545
               Desyr al newe him brende, and lust to brede
               Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede.

               Criseyde also, right in the same wyse,
               Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette
               His worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wyse,           1550
               His gentilesse, and how she with him mette,
               Thonkinge love he so wel hir bisette;
               Desyring eft to have hir herte dere
               In swich a plyt, she dorste make him chere.

               Pandare, a-morwe which that comen was                1555
               Un-to his nece, and gan hir fayre grete,
               Seyde, `Al this night so reyned it, allas!
               That al my drede is that ye, nece swete,
               Han litel layser had to slepe and mete;
               Al night,' quod he, `hath reyn so do me wake,        1560
               That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.'

               And ner he com, and seyde, `How stont it now
               This mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?'
               Criseyde answerde, `Never the bet for yow,
               Fox that ye been, god yeve youre herte care!         1565
               God help me so, ye caused al this fare,
               Trow I,' quod she, `for alle your wordes whyte;
               O! Who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!'

               With that she gan hir face for to wrye
               With the shete, and wex for shame al reed;           1570
               And Pandarus gan under for to prye,
               And seyde, `Nece, if that I shal be deed,
               Have here a swerd, and smyteth of myn heed.'
               With that his arm al sodeynly he thriste
               Under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste.         1575

               I passe al that which chargeth nought to seye,
               What! God foryaf his deeth, and she al-so
               Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye,
               For other cause was ther noon than so.
               But of this thing right to the effect to go,         1580
               Whan tyme was, hom til hir hous she wente,
               And Pandarus hath fully his entente.

               Now torne we ayein to Troilus,
               That resteles ful longe a-bedde lay,
               And prevely sente after Pandarus,                    1585
               To him to come in al the haste he may.
               He com anoon, nought ones seyde he `nay,'
               And Troilus ful sobrely he grette,
               And doun upon his beddes syde him sette.

               This Troilus, with al the affeccioun                 1590
               Of frendes love that herte may devyse,
               To Pandarus on knees fil adoun,
               And er that he wolde of the place aryse,
               He gan him thonken in his beste wyse;
               An hondred sythe he gan the tyme blesse,             1595
               That he was born, to bringe him fro distresse.

               He seyde, `O frend of frendes the alderbeste
               That ever was, the sothe for to telle,
               Thou hast in hevene y-brought my soule at reste
               Fro Flegitoun, the fery flood of helle;              1600
               That, though I mighte a thousand tymes selle,
               Upon a day, my lyf in thy servyse,
               It mighte nought a mote in that suffyse.

               `The sonne, which that al the world may see,
               Saw never yet, my lyf, that dar I leye,              1605
               So inly fayr and goodly as is she,
               Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deye;
               And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye,
               That thanked be the heighe worthinesse
               Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse.                1610

               `Thus hastow me no litel thing y-yive,
               Fo which to thee obliged be for ay
               My lyf, and why? For thorugh thyn help I live;
               For elles deed hadde I be many a day.'
               And with that word doun in his bed he lay,           1615
               And Pandarus ful sobrely him herde
               Til al was seyd, and than he thus answerde:

               `My dere frend, if I have doon for thee
               In any cas, god wot, it is me leef;
               And am as glad as man may of it be,                  1620
               God help me so; but tak now a-greef
               That I shal seyn, be war of this myscheef,
               That, there-as thou now brought art in-to blisse,
               That thou thy-self ne cause it nought to misse.

               `For of fortunes sharpe adversitee                   1625
               The worst kinde of infortune is this,
               A man to have ben in prosperitee,
               And it remembren, whan it passed is.
               Thou art wys y-nough, for-thy do nought amis;
               Be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme,
               For if thou be, certeyn, it wol thee harme.          1631

               `Thou art at ese, and holde the wel ther-inne.
               For also seur as reed is every fyr,
               As greet a craft is kepe wel as winne;
               Brydle alwey wel thy speche and thy desyr,           1635
               For worldly Ioye halt not but by a wyr;
               That preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte;
               For-thy nede is to werke with it softe.'

               Quod Troilus, `I hope, and god to-forn,
               My dere frend, that I shal so me bere,               1640
               That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn,
               Ne I nil not rakle as for to greven here;
               It nedeth not this matere ofte tere;
               For wistestow myn herte wel, Pandare,
               God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.'          1645

               Tho gan he telle him of his glade night,
               And wher-of first his herte dredde, and how,
               And seyde, `Freend, as I am trewe knight,
               And by that feyth I shal to god and yow,
               I hadde it never half so hote as now;                1650
               And ay the more that desyr me byteth
               To love hir best, the more it me delyteth.

               `I noot my-self not wisly what it is;
               But now I fele a newe qualitee,
               Ye, al another than I dide er this.'                 1655
               Pandare answerde, and seyde thus, that he
               That ones may in hevene blisse be,
               He feleth other weyes, dar I leye,
               Than thilke tyme he first herde of it seye.

               This is o word for al: this Troilus                  1660
               Was never ful to speke of this matere,
               And for to preysen un-to Pandarus
               The bountee of his righte lady dere,
               And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere.
               This tale ay was span-newe to biginne,               1665
               Til that the night departed hem a-twinne.

               Sone after this, for that fortune it wolde,
               I-comen was the blisful tyme swete,
               That Troilus was warned that he sholde,
               Ther he was erst, Criseyde his lady mete;            1670
               For which he felte his herte in Ioye flete;
               And feythfully gan alle the goddes herie;
               And lat see now if that he can be merie.

               And holden was the forme and al the wyse,
               Of hir cominge, and eek of his also,                 1675
               As it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse.
               But playnly to the effect right for to go,
               In Ioye and suerte Pandarus hem two
               A-bedde broughte, whan that hem bothe leste,
               And thus they ben in quiete and in reste.            1680

               Nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met,
               To aske at me if that they blythe were;
               For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet
               A thousand-fold, this nedeth not enquere.
               A-gon was every sorwe and every fere;                1685
               And bothe, y-wis, they hadde, and so they wende,
               As muche Ioye as herte may comprende.

               This is no litel thing of for to seye,
               This passeth every wit for to devyse;
               For eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye;              1690
               Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wyse
               Commenden so, ne may not here suffyse.
               This Ioye may not writen been with inke,
               This passeth al that herte may bithinke.

               But cruel day, so wel-awey the stounde!              1695
               Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe,
               For whiche hem thoughte felen dethes wounde;
               So wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe,
               And day they goonnen to dispyse al newe,
               Calling it traytour, envyous, and worse,             1700
               And bitterly the dayes light they curse.

               Quod Troilus, `Allas! Now am I war
               That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three,
               Whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char,
               Han goon som by-path in despyt of me;                1705
               That maketh it so sone day to be;
               And, for the sonne him hasteth thus to ryse,
               Ne shal I never doon him sacrifyse!'

               But nedes day departe moste hem sone,
               And whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere,        1710
               They twinne anoon as they were wont to done,
               And setten tyme of meting eft y-fere;
               And many a night they wroughte in this manere.
               And thus Fortune a tyme ladde in Ioye
               Criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of Troye.         1715

               In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges,
               This Troilus gan al his lyf to lede;
               He spendeth, Iusteth, maketh festeynges;
               He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede,
               And held aboute him alwey, out of drede,             1720
               A world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde,
               The fressheste and the beste he coude fynde;

               That swich a voys was of hym and a stevene
               Thorugh-out the world, of honour and largesse,
               That it up rong un-to the yate of hevene.            1725
               And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse,
               That in his herte he demede, as I gesse,
               That there nis lovere in this world at ese
               So wel as he, and thus gan love him plese.

               The godlihede or beautee which that kinde            1730
               In any other lady hadde y-set
               Can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde,
               A-boute his herte, of al Criseydes net.
               He was so narwe y-masked and y-knet,
               That it undon on any manere syde,                    1735
               That nil not been, for ought that may betyde.

               And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take
               This Pandarus, and in-to gardin lede,
               And swich a feste and swich a proces make
               Him of Criseyde, and of hir womanhede,               1740
               And of hir beautee, that, with-outen drede,
               It was an hevene his wordes for to here;
               And thanne he wolde singe in this manere.

               `Love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce,
               Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye,            1745
               Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
               Halt peples ioyned, as him list hem gye,
               Love, that knetteth lawe of companye,
               And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle,
               Bind this acord, that I have told and telle;         1750

               `That that the world with feyth, which that is stable,
               Dyverseth so his stoundes concordinge,
               That elements that been so discordable
               Holden a bond perpetuely duringe,
               That Phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe,          1755
               And that the mone hath lordship over the nightes,
               Al this doth Love; ay heried be his mightes!

               `That, that the see, that gredy is to flowen,
               Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so
               His flodes, that so fersly they ne growen            1760
               To drenchen erthe and al for ever-mo;
               And if that Love ought lete his brydel go,
               Al that now loveth a-sonder sholde lepe,
               And lost were al, that Love halt now to-hepe.

               `So wolde god, that auctor is of kinde,              1765
               That, with his bond, Love of his vertu liste
               To cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde,
               That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste.
               And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste
               To make hem love, and that hem leste ay rewe         1770
               On hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.'

               In alle nedes, for the tounes werre,
               He was, and ay the firste in armes dight;
               And certeynly, but-if that bokes erre,
               Save Ector, most y-drad of any wight;                1775
               And this encrees of hardinesse and might
               Cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne,
               That altered his spirit so with-inne.

               In tyme of trewe, on haukinge wolde he ryde,
               Or elles hunten boor, bere, or lyoun;                1780
               The smale bestes leet he gon bi-syde.
               And whan that he com rydinge in-to toun,
               Ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun,
               As fresh as faucon comen out of muwe,
               Ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe.                  1785

               And most of love and vertu was his speche,
               And in despyt hadde alle wrecchednesse;
               And doutelees, no nede was him biseche
               To honouren hem that hadde worthinesse,
               And esen hem that weren in distresse.                1790
               And glad was he if any wight wel ferde,
               That lover was, whan he it wiste or herde.

               For sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight
               But-if he were in loves heigh servyse,
               I mene folk that oughte it been of right.            1795
               And over al this, so wel coude he devyse
               Of sentement, and in so unkouth wyse
               Al his array, that every lover thoughte,
               That al was wel, what-so he seyde or wroughte.

               And though that he be come of blood royal,           1800
               Him liste of pryde at no wight for to chase;
               Benigne he was to ech in general,
               For which he gat him thank in every place.
               Thus wolde love, y-heried be his grace,
               That Pryde, Envye, Ire, and Avaryce                  1805
               He gan to flee, and every other vyce.

                 But al to litel, weylaway the whyle,
               Lasteth swich Ioye, y-thonked be Fortune!
               That semeth trewest, whan she wol bygyle,

               And whan a wight is from hir wheel y-throwe,
               Than laugheth she, and maketh him the mowe.

               From Troilus she gan hir brighte face
               Awey to wrythe, and took of him non hede,
               But caste him clene out of his lady grace,             10

               Explicit prohemium.

               Incipit Quartus Liber.

               Ligginge in ost, as I have seyd er this,
               The Grekes stronge, aboute Troye toun,                 30
               Bifel that, whan that Phebus shyning is
               Up-on the brest of Hercules Lyoun,
               That Ector, with ful many a bold baroun,
               Caste on a day with Grekes for to fighte,
               As he was wont to greve hem what he mighte.            35

               Not I how longe or short it was bitwene
               This purpos and that day they fighte mente;
               But on a day wel armed, bright and shene,
               Ector, and many a worthy wight out wente,
               With spere in hond and bigge bowes bente;              40
               And in the herd, with-oute lenger lette,
               Hir fomen in the feld anoon hem mette.

               The longe day, with speres sharpe y-grounde,
               With arwes, dartes, swerdes, maces felle,
               They fighte and bringen hors and man to grounde,       45
               And with hir axes out the braynes quelle.
               But in the laste shour, sooth for to telle,
               The folk of Troye hem-selven so misledden,
               That with the worse at night homward they fledden.

               At whiche day was taken Antenor,                       50
               Maugre Polydamas or Monesteo,
               Santippe, Sarpedon, Polynestor,
               Polyte, or eek the Troian daun Ripheo,
               And othere lasse folk, as Phebuseo.
               So that, for harm, that day the folk of Troye          55
               Dredden to lese a greet part of hir Ioye.

               Of Pryamus was yeve, at Greek requeste,
               A tyme of trewe, and tho they gonnen trete,
               Hir prisoneres to chaungen, moste and leste,
               And for the surplus yeven sommes grete.                60
               This thing anoon was couth in every strete,
               Bothe in thassege, in toune, and every-where,
               And with the firste it cam to Calkas ere.

               Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde,
               In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone                 65
               He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde,
               And sette him there-as he was wont to done;
               And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone,
               For love of god, to don that reverence,
               To stinte noyse, and yeve him audience.                70

               Thanne seyde he thus, `Lo! Lordes myne, I was
               Troian, as it is knowen out of drede;
               And, if that yow remembre, I am Calkas,
               That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede,
               And tolde wel how that ye sholden spede.               75
               For dredelees, thorugh yow, shal, in a stounde,
               Ben Troye y-brend, and beten doun to grounde.

               `And in what forme, or in what maner wyse

               This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve.
               And for the Grekes weren me so leve,
               I com my-self in my propre persone,

               Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye,
               Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke,

               That, for to hele him of his sorwes sore,
               They yave him Antenor, with-oute more.

               But who was glad y-nough but Calkas tho?
               And of this thing ful sone his nedes leyde            135
               On hem that sholden for the tretis go,
               And hem for Antenor ful ofte preyde
               To bringen hoom king Toas and Criseyde;
               And whan Pryam his save-garde sente,
               Thembassadours to Troye streyght they wente.          140

               The cause y-told of hir cominge, the olde
               Pryam the king ful sone in general
               Let here-upon his parlement to holde,

               Theschaunge of prisoners and al this nede
               Hem lyketh wel, and forth in they procede.

               This Troilus was present in the place,
               Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde,
               For which ful sone chaungen gan his face,             150
               As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deyde.
               But nathelees, he no word to it seyde,
               Lest men sholde his affeccioun espye;
               With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drye.

               And ful of anguissh and of grisly drede               155
               Abood what lordes wolde un-to it seye;
               And if they wolde graunte, as god forbede,
               Theschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye,
               First, how to save hir honour, and what weye
               He mighte best theschaunge of hir withstonde;         160
               Ful faste he caste how al this mighte stonde.

               Love him made al prest to doon hir byde,
               And rather dye than she sholde go;
               But resoun seyde him, on that other syde,
               `With-oute assent of hir ne do not so,                165
               Lest for thy werk she wolde be thy fo,
               And seyn, that thorugh thy medling is y-blowe
               Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.'

               For which he gan deliberen, for the beste,
               That though the lordes wolde that she wente,          170
               He wolde lat hem graunte what hem leste,
               And telle his lady first what that they mente.
               And whan that she had seyd him hir entente,
               Ther-after wolde he werken also blyve,
               Though al the world ayein it wolde stryve.            175

               Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde,
               For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,
               Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde: --
               `Sires, she nis no prisoner,' he seyde;
               `I noot on yow who that this charge leyde,            180
               But, on my part, ye may eft-sone hem telle,
               We usen here no wommen for to selle.'

               The noyse of peple up-stirte thanne at ones,
               As breme as blase of straw y-set on fyre;
               For infortune it wolde, for the nones,                185
               They sholden hir confusioun desyre.
               `Ector,' quod they, `what goost may yow enspyre
               This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese
               Daun Antenor? -- a wrong wey now ye chese --

               `That is so wys, and eek so bold baroun,              190
               And we han nede to folk, as men may see;

               O Ector, lat tho fantasyes be!
               O king Priam,' quod they, `thus seggen we,
               That al our voys is to for-gon Criseyde;'             195
               And to deliveren Antenor they preyde.

               O Iuvenal, lord! Trewe is thy sentence,
               That litel witen folk what is to yerne
               That they ne finde in hir desyr offence;
               For cloud of errour let hem not descerne              200
               What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne.
               This folk desiren now deliveraunce
               Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce!

               For he was after traytour to the toun
               Of Troye; allas! They quitte him out to rathe;        205
               O nyce world, lo, thy discrecioun!
               Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe,
               Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe;
               But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune,
               And she shal out; thus seyden here and howne.         210

               For which delibered was by parlement
               For Antenor to yelden out Criseyde,
               And it pronounced by the president,
               Al-theigh that Ector `nay' ful ofte preyde.
               And fynaly, what wight that it with-seyde,            215
               It was for nought, it moste been, and sholde;
               For substaunce of the parlement it wolde.

               Departed out of parlement echone,
               This Troilus, with-oute wordes mo,
               Un-to his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,           220
               But-if it were a man of his or two,
               The whiche he bad out faste for to go,
               By-cause he wolde slepen, as he seyde,
               And hastely up-on his bed him leyde.

               And as in winter leves been biraft,                   225
               Eche after other, til the tree be bare,
               So that ther nis but bark and braunche y-laft,
               Lyth Troilus, biraft of ech wel-fare,
               Y-bounden in the blake bark of care,
               Disposed wood out of his wit to breyde,               230
               So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde.

               He rist him up, and every dore he shette
               And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man
               Up-on his beddes syde a-doun him sette,
               Ful lyk a deed image pale and wan;                    235
               And in his brest the heped wo bigan
               Out-breste, and he to werken in this wyse
               In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devyse.

               Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe
               Now here, now there, y-darted to the herte,           240
               And of his deeth roreth in compleyninge,
               Right so gan he aboute the chaumbre sterte,
               Smyting his brest ay with his festes smerte;
               His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde
               Ful ofte he swapte, him-selven to confounde.          245

               His eyen two, for pitee of his herte,
               Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye;
               The heighe sobbes of his sorwes smerte
               His speche him refte, unnethes mighte he seye,
               `O deeth, allas! Why niltow do me deye?               250
               A-cursed be the day which that nature
               Shoop me to ben a lyves creature!'

               But after, whan the furie and the rage
               Which that his herte twiste and faste threste,
               By lengthe of tyme somwhat gan asswage,               255
               Up-on his bed he leyde him doun to reste;
               But tho bigonne his teres more out-breste,
               That wonder is, the body may suffyse
               To half this wo, which that I yow devyse.

               Than seyde he thus, `Fortune! Allas the whyle!        260
               What have I doon, what have I thus a-gilt?
               How mightestow for reuthe me bigyle?
               Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt?
               Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt?
               Allas! How maystow in thyn herte finde                265
               To been to me thus cruel and unkinde?

               `Have I thee nought honoured al my lyve,

               Why wiltow me fro Ioye thus depryve?
               O Troilus, what may men now thee calle                270
               But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle
               In-to miserie, in which I wol biwayle

               `Allas, Fortune! If that my lyf in Ioye
               Displesed hadde un-to thy foule envye,                275

               Or slayn my-self, that thus compleyne and crye,
               I, combre-world, that may of no-thing serve,
               But ever dye, and never fully sterve?                 280

               `If that Criseyde allone were me laft,

               To preve in that thy gerful violence.

               `O verray lord of love, O god, allas!

               Pandare, which that in the parlement
               Hadde herd what every lord and burgeys seyde,         345
               And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,
               For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,

               Toward the bed gan softely to goon,                   355
               So confus, that he niste what to seye;
               For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye.

               And with his chere and loking al to-torn,
               For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden,
               He stood this woful Troilus biforn,                   360
               And on his pitous face he gan biholden;

               His herte slow, as thoughte him, for distresse.

               This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte            365
               His freend Pandare y-comen him to see,

               And with a sorwful noyse he seyde thus,

               `Lo! Pandare, I am deed, with-outen more.
               Hastow nought herd at parlement,' he seyde,
               `For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?'

               This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe,
               Ful pitously answerde and seyde, `Yis!                380

               `For in this world ther is no creature,

               But who may al eschewe, or al devyne?

               And seyde, `Freend, sin thou hast swich distresse,

               To this answerde him Troilus ful softe,               540
               And seyde, `Parde, leve brother dere,

               `I have eek thought, so it were hir assent,

               `Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe

               It moste been disclaundre to hir name.
               And me were lever deed than hir defame,               565
               As nolde god but-if I sholde have

               `Thus am I lost, for ought that I can see;

               Thus wepinge that he coude never cesse,               575
               He seyde, `Allas! How shal I, wrecche, fare?
               For wel fele I alwey my love encresse,
               And hope is lasse and lasse alwey, Pandare!

               For, as in love, ther is but litel reste.'

               Pandare answerde, `Freend, thou mayst, for me,
               Don as thee list; but hadde ich it so hote,
               And thyn estat, she sholde go with me;

               I nolde sette at al that noyse a grote.
               For when men han wel cryed, than wol they roune;
               A wonder last but nyne night never in toune.

               `Devyne not in reson ay so depe

               Rys up, for by myn heed, she shal not goon;
               And rather be in blame a lyte y-founde
               Than sterve here as a gnat, with-oute wounde.         595

               `It is no shame un-to yow, ne no vyce

               `And though thy lady wolde a litel hir greve,

               Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse.

               `For-thy tak herte, and thenk, right as a knight,

               This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken,
               And seyde, `Freend, graunt mercy, ich assente;

               The swifte Fame, whiche that false thinges
               Egal reporteth lyk the thinges trewe,                 660
               Was thorugh-out Troye y-fled with preste winges
               Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe,
               How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe,
               At parlement, with-oute wordes more,
               I-graunted was in chaunge of Antenore.                665

               The whiche tale anoon-right as Criseyde
               Had herd, she, which that of hir fader roughte,

               But shortly, lest thise tales sothe were,
               She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere.

               As she that hadde hir herte and al hir minde
               On Troilus y-set so wonder faste,
               That al this world ne mighte hir love unbinde,        675
               Ne Troilus out of hir herte caste;
               She wol ben his, whyl that hir lyf may laste.
               And thus she brenneth bothe in love and drede,
               So that she niste what was best to rede.

               A-nother seyde, `Y-wis, so nam not I,

               Tho wordes and tho wommanisshe thinges,
               She herde hem right as though she thennes were;       695
               For, god it wot, hir herte on other thing is,
               Although the body sat among hem there.
               Hir advertence is alwey elles-where;
               For Troilus ful faste hir soule soughte;
               With-outen word, alwey on him she thoughte.           700

               Thise wommen, that thus wenden hir to plese,

               So that she felte almost hir herte deye
               For wo, and wery of that companye.

               For which no lenger mighte she restreyne
               Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle,
               That yaven signes of the bitter peyne                 710
               In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle;
               Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle
               She fallen was, sith she forgoth the sighte
               Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.

               And thilke foles sittinge hir aboute                  715
               Wenden, that she wepte and syked sore
               By-cause that she sholde out of that route
               Departe, and never pleye with hem more.
               And they that hadde y-knowen hir of yore
               Seye hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse,         720
               And eche of hem wepte eek for hir destresse;

               And bisily they gonnen hir conforten
               Of thing, god wot, on which she litel thoughte;
               And with hir tales wenden hir disporten,
               And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.              725
               But swich an ese ther-with they hir wroughte
               Right as a man is esed for to fele,
               For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele!

               But after al this nyce vanitee
               They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.        730
               Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,
               In-to hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle,
               And on hir bed she gan for deed to falle,
               In purpos never thennes for to ryse;
               And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devyse.          735

               Bar witnes of hir wo and hir constreynte;
               And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleynte:

               `Alas!' quod she, `out of this regioun

               She held hir-self a forlost creature.

               She seyde, `How shal he doon, and I also?
               How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?
               O dere herte eek, that I love so,

               How sholde a plaunte or lyves creature
               Live, with-oute his kinde noriture?
               For which ful oft a by-word here I seye,

               But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seyde

               But to the pitouse goddes everichone
               Ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone,            950
               To doon him sone out of this world to pace;
               For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace.

               For in him nede of sittinge is, y-wis,

               `Thus on this same wyse, out of doutaunce,

               Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,
               That thing to come sholde cause his prescience.

               `What mighte I wene, and I hadde swich a thought,    1065
               But that god purveyth thing that is to come
               For that it is to come, and elles nought?
               So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some,

               Y-wis, that thing mot nedefully be so;
               Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming,            1075
               So mot it come; and thus the bifalling
               Of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde,

               Than seyde he thus, `Almighty Iove in trone,

               Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.'
               And whyl he was in al this hevinesse,
               Disputinge with him-self in this matere,
               Com Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here.            1085

               `O mighty god,' quod Pandarus, `in trone,
               Ey! Who seigh ever a wys man faren so?
               Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?
               Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo?
               What, parde, yet is not Criseyde a-go!               1090
               Why list thee so thy-self for-doon for drede,
               That in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede?

               `Hastow not lived many a yeer biforn
               With-outen hir, and ferd ful wel at ese?
               Artow for hir and for non other born?                1095
               Hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese?
               Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese.
               That, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces,
               Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces.

               `And yet this is a wonder most of alle,              1100
               Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit,
               Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle,
               Ne if she can hir-self distorben it.
               Thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit.
               A man may al by tyme his nekke bede                  1105
               Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede.

               `For-thy take hede of that that I shal seye;
               I have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be,
               So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye.
               And ever-mor me thinketh thus, that she              1110
               Hath som-what in hir hertes prevetee,
               Wher-with she can, if I shal right arede,
               Distorbe al this, of which thou art in drede.

               `For which my counseil is, whan it is night,
               Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende;            1115
               And blisful Iuno, thourgh hir grete mighte,
               Shal, as I hope, hir grace un-to us sende.
               Myn herte seyth, "Certeyn, she shal not wende;"
               And for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste;
               And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.'          1120

               This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore,
               `Thou seyst right wel, and I wil do right so;'
               And what him liste, he seyde un-to it more.
               And whan that it was tyme for to go,
               Ful prevely him-self, with-outen mo,                 1125
               Un-to hir com, as he was wont to done;
               And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.

               Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete,
               So gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste,
               That neither of hem other mighte grete,              1130
               But hem in armes toke and after kiste.
               The lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste
               Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe,
               As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge.

               Tho woful teres that they leten falle                1135
               As bittre weren, out of teres kinde,
               For peyne, as is ligne aloes or galle.
               So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde,
               The woful Myrra through the bark and rinde.
               That in this world ther nis so hard an herte,        1140
               That nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte.

               But whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne
               Retorned been ther-as hem oughte dwelle,
               And that som-what to wayken gan the peyne
               By lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle       1145
               Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle,
               With broken voys, al hoors for-shright, Criseyde
               To Troilus thise ilke wordes seyde:

               `O Iove, I deye, and mercy I beseche!
               Help, Troilus!' And ther-with-al hir face            1150
               Upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche;
               Hir woful spirit from his propre place,
               Right with the word, alwey up poynt to pace.
               And thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene,
               That whylom fresh and fairest was to sene.           1155

               This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,
               Clepinge hir name, (and she lay as for deed,
               With-oute answere, and felte hir limes colde,
               Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed),
               This sorwful man can now noon other reed,            1160
               But ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste;
               Wher him was wo, god and him-self it wiste!

               He rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde;
               For signe of lyf, for ought he can or may,
               Can he noon finde in no-thing on Criseyde,           1165
               For which his song ful ofte is `weylaway!'
               But whan he saugh that specheles she lay,
               With sorwful voys and herte of blisse al bare,
               He seyde how she was fro this world y-fare!

               So after that he longe hadde hir compleyned,         1170
               His hondes wrong, and seyde that was to seye,
               And with his teres salte hir brest bireyned,
               He gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye,
               And pitously gan for the soule preye,
               And seyde, `O lord, that set art in thy trone,       1175
               Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!'

               She cold was and with-outen sentement,
               For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon;
               And this was him a preignant argument
               That she was forth out of this world agoon;          1180
               And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,
               He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere
               As men don hem that shul be leyd on bere.

               And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,
               His swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte,       1185
               Him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte,
               So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte,
               Ther-as the doom of Mynos wolde it dighte;
               Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,
               That in this world he lenger liven sholde.           1190

               Thanne seyde he thus, fulfild of heigh desdayn,
               `O cruel Iove, and thou, Fortune adverse,
               This al and som, that falsly have ye slayn
               Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,
               Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!              1195
               Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;
               Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.

               `For I this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus,
               Wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye;
               Shal never lover seyn that Troilus                   1200
               Dar not, for fere, with his lady dye;
               For certeyn, I wol bere hir companye.
               But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here,
               Yet suffreth that our soules ben y-fere.

               `And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,          1205
               And thou, Pryam, and bretheren al y-fere,
               And thou, my moder, farwel! For I go;
               And Attropos, make redy thou my bere!
               And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere,
               Receyve now my spirit!' wolde he seye,               1210
               With swerd at herte, al redy for to deye

               But as god wolde, of swough ther-with she abreyde,
               And gan to syke, and `Troilus' she cryde;
               And he answerde, `Lady myn Criseyde,
               Live ye yet?' and leet his swerd doun glyde.         1215
               `Ye, herte myn, that thanked be Cupyde!'
               Quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte;
               And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte;

               Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,
               And hir to glade he dide al his entente;             1220
               For which hir goost, that flikered ay on-lofte,
               In-to hir woful herte ayein it wente.
               But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente
               A-syde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye,
               As it lay bare, and gan for fere crye,               1225

               And asked him, why he it hadde out-drawe?
               And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,
               And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe.
               For which Criseyde up-on him gan biholde,
               And gan him in hir armes faste folde,                1230
               And seyde, `O mercy, god, lo, which a dede!
               Allas! How neigh we were bothe dede!

               `Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was,
               Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?' quod she.
               `Ye, douteless;' and she answerde, `Allas!           1235
               For, by that ilke lord that made me,
               I nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be,
               After your deeth, to han been crouned quene
               Of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene.

               `But with this selve swerd, which that here is,      1240
               My-selve I wolde han slayn!' -- quod she tho;
               `But ho, for we han right y-now of this,
               And late us ryse and streight to bedde go
               And there lat ys speken of oure wo.
               For, by the morter which that I see brenne,          1245
               Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.'

               Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde,
               Nought was it lyk tho nightes here-biforn;
               For pitously ech other gan biholde,

               Biwaylinge ay the day that they were born.
               Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde
               To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde: --

               `Lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,' quod she,
               `That if a wight alwey his wo compleyne,             1255
               And seketh nought how holpen for to be,
               It nis but folye and encrees of peyne;
               And sin that here assembled be we tweyne
               To finde bote of wo that we ben inne,

               `I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot,
               And as I am avysed sodeynly,
               So wol I telle yow, whyl it is hoot.
               Me thinketh thus, that nouther ye nor I
               Oughte half this wo to make skilfully.               1265
               For there is art y-now for to redresse
               That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse.

               `Sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne,

               But what is thanne a remede un-to this,

               And she ne daunteth no wight but a wrecche.

               `And trusteth this, that certes, herte swete,        1590

               `And now, so this be sooth,' quod Troilus,
               `I shal wel suffre un-to the tenthe day,
               Sin that I see that nede it moot be thus.
               But, for the love of god, if it be may,              1600
               So lat us stele prively away;

               I see wel now that ye mistrusten me;
               For by your wordes it is wel y-sene.
               Now, for the love of Cynthia the shene,

               To this answerde Troilus and seyde,
               `Now god, to whom ther nis no cause y-wrye,
               Me glade, as wis I never un-to Criseyde,             1655

               Was fals, ne never shal til that I dye.
               At shorte wordes, wel ye may me leve;

               `Graunt mercy, goode myn, y-wis,' quod she,          1660
               `And blisful Venus lat me never sterve

               That ay honour to me-ward shal rebounde.

               `For trusteth wel, that your estat royal

               Ne made me to rewe on your distresse;
               But moral vertue, grounded upon trouthe,
               That was the cause I first hadde on yow routhe!

               `Eek gentil herte and manhod that ye hadde,

               And that your reson brydled your delyt,
               This made, aboven every creature,
               That I was your, and shal, whyl I may dure.          1680

               But Iuppiter, that of his might may do
               The sorwful to be glad, so yeve us grace,
               Er nightes ten, to meten in this place,              1685
               So that it may your herte and myn suffyse;
               And fareth now wel, for tyme is that ye ryse.'

               And after that they longe y-pleyned hadde,
               And ofte y-kist, and streite in armes folde,
               The day gan ryse, and Troilus him cladde,            1690
               And rewfulliche his lady gan biholde,
               As he that felte dethes cares colde,

               The golden-tressed Phebus heighe on-lofte
               Thryes hadde alle with his bemes shene
               The snowes molte, and Zephirus as ofte                 10
               Y-brought ayein the tendre leves grene,
               Sin that the sone of Ecuba the quene
               Bigan to love hir first, for whom his sorwe
               Was al, that she departe sholde a-morwe.

               Ful redy was at pryme Dyomede,                         15
               Criseyde un-to the Grekes ost to lede,
               For sorwe of which she felt hir herte blede,
               As she that niste what was best to rede.
               And trewely, as men in bokes rede,
               Men wiste never womman han the care,                   20
               Ne was so looth out of a toun to fare.

               This Troilus, with-outen reed or lore,
               As man that hath his Ioyes eek forlore,
               Was waytinge on his lady ever-more
               As she that was the soothfast crop and more            25
               Of al his lust, or Ioyes here-tofore.
               But Troilus, now farewel al thy Ioye,
               For shaltow never seen hir eft in Troye!

               Soth is, that whyl he bood in this manere,
               He gan his wo ful manly for to hyde.                   30
               That wel unnethe it seen was in his chere;
               But at the yate ther she sholde oute ryde
               With certeyn folk, he hoved hir tabyde,
               So wo bigoon, al wolde he nought him pleyne,
               That on his hors unnethe he sat for peyne.             35

               For ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe,
               Whan Diomede on horse gan him dresse,
               And seyde un-to him-self this ilke sawe,
               `Allas,' quod he, `thus foul a wrecchednesse
               Why suffre ich it, why nil ich it redresse?            40
               Were it not bet at ones for to dye
               Than ever-more in langour thus to drye?

               `Why nil I make at ones riche and pore
               To have y-nough to done, er that she go?
               Why nil I bringe al Troye upon a rore?                 45
               Why nil I sleen this Diomede also?
               Why nil I rather with a man or two
               Stele hir a-way? Why wol I this endure?
               Why nil I helpen to myn owene cure?'

               But why he nolde doon so fel a dede,                   50
               That shal I seyn, and why him liste it spare;
               He hadde in herte alweyes a maner drede,
               Lest that Criseyde, in rumour of this fare,
               Sholde han ben slayn; lo, this was al his care.
               And ellis, certeyn, as I seyde yore,                   55
               He hadde it doon, with-outen wordes more.

               Criseyde, whan she redy was to ryde,
               Ful sorwfully she sighte, and seyde `Allas!'
               But forth she moot, for ought that may bityde,
               And forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas.                 60
               Ther nis non other remedie in this cas.
               What wonder is though that hir sore smerte,
               Whan she forgoth hir owene swete herte?

               This Troilus, in wyse of curteisye,
               With hauke on hond, and with an huge route             65
               Of knightes, rood and dide hir companye,
               Passinge al the valey fer with-oute,
               And ferther wolde han riden, out of doute,
               Ful fayn, and wo was him to goon so sone;
               But torne he moste, and it was eek to done.            70

               And right with that was Antenor y-come
               Out of the Grekes ost, and every wight
               Was of it glad, and seyde he was wel-come.
               And Troilus, al nere his herte light,
               He peyned him with al his fulle might                  75
               Him to with-holde of wepinge at the leste,
               And Antenor he kiste, and made feste.

               And ther-with-al he moste his leve take,
               And caste his eye upon hir pitously,
               And neer he rood, his cause for to make,               80
               To take hir by the honde al sobrely.
               And lord! So she gan wepen tendrely!
               And he ful softe and sleighly gan hir seye,
               `Now hold your day, and dooth me not to deye.'

               With that his courser torned he a-boute                85
               With face pale, and un-to Diomede
               No word he spak, ne noon of al his route;
               Of which the sone of Tydeus took hede,
               As he that coude more than the crede
               In swich a craft, and by the reyne hir hente;          90
               And Troilus to Troye homwarde he wente.

               This Diomede, that ladde hir by the brydel,
               Whan that he saw the folk of Troye aweye,
               Thoughte, `Al my labour shal not been on ydel,
               If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye,                95
               For at the worste it may yet shorte our weye.
               I have herd seyd, eek tymes twyes twelve,
               "He is a fool that wol for-yete him-selve."'

               But natheles this thoughte he wel ynough,
               `That certaynly I am aboute nought,                   100
               If that I speke of love, or make it tough;
               For douteles, if she have in hir thought
               Him that I gesse, he may not been y-brought
               So sone awey; but I shal finde a mene,
               That she not wite as yet shal what I mene.'           105

               This Diomede, as he that coude his good,
               Whan this was doon, gan fallen forth in speche
               Of this and that, and asked why she stood
               In swich disese, and gan hir eek biseche,
               That if that he encrese mighte or eche                110
               With any thing hir ese, that she sholde
               Comaunde it him, and seyde he doon it wolde.

               For trewely he swoor hir, as a knight,
               That ther nas thing with whiche he mighte hir plese,
               That he nolde doon his peyne and al his might         115
               To doon it, for to doon hir herte an ese.
               And preyede hir, she wolde hir sorwe apese,
               And seyde, `Y-wis, we Grekes con have Ioye
               To honouren yow, as wel as folk of Troye.'

               He seyde eek thus, `I woot, yow thinketh straunge,    120
               No wonder is, for it is to yow newe,
               Thaqueintaunce of these Troianis to chaunge,
               For folk of Grece, that ye never knewe.
               But wolde never god but-if as trewe
               A Greek ye shulde among us alle finde                 125
               As any Troian is, and eek as kinde.

               `And by the cause I swoor yow right, lo, now,

               And for that more aqueintaunce eek of yow
               Have ich had than another straunger wight,            130
               So fro this forth, I pray yow, day and night,
               Comaundeth me, how sore that me smerte,
               To doon al that may lyke un-to your herte;

               `And that ye me wolde as your brother trete,
               And taketh not my frendship in despyt;                135
               And though your sorwes be for thinges grete,
               Noot I not why, but out of more respyt,
               Myn herte hath for to amende it greet delyt.
               And if I may your harmes not redresse,
               I am right sory for your hevinesse,                   140

               `And though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe

               And, for the love of god, my lady free,

               For trewely, ther can no wight yow serve,
               That half so looth your wraththe wolde deserve.

               `And nere it that we been so neigh the tente

               But this enseled til another day.
               Yeve me your hond, I am, and shal ben ay,

               Criseide un-to that purpos lyte answerde,
               As she that was with sorwe oppressed so
               That, in effect, she nought his tales herde,
               But here and there, now here a word or two.
               Hir thoughte hir sorwful herte brast a-two.           180
               For whan she gan hir fader fer aspye,
               Wel neigh doun of hir hors she gan to sye.

               But natheles she thonked Diomede
               Of al his travaile, and his goode chere,
               And that him liste his friendship hir to bede;        185
               And she accepteth it in good manere,
               And wolde do fayn that is him leef and dere;
               And trusten him she wolde, and wel she mighte,
               As seyde she, and from hir hors she alighte.

               Hir fader hath hir in his armes nome,                 190
               And tweynty tyme he kiste his doughter swete,
               And seyde, `O dere doughter myn, wel-come!'
               She seyde eek, she was fayn with him to mete,
               And stood forth mewet, milde, and mansuete.
               But here I leve hir with hir fader dwelle,            195
               And forth I wol of Troilus yow telle.

               To Troye is come this woful Troilus,
               In sorwe aboven alle sorwes smerte,
               With felon look, and face dispitous.
               Tho sodeinly doun from his hors he sterte,            200
               And thorugh his paleys, with a swollen herte,
               To chambre he wente; of no-thing took he hede,
               Ne noon to him dar speke a word for drede.

               And there his sorwes that he spared hadde
               He yaf an issue large, and `Deeth!' he cryde;         205
               And in his throwes frenetyk and madde
               He cursed Iove, Appollo, and eek Cupyde,
               He cursed Ceres, Bacus, and Cipryde,
               His burthe, him-self, his fate, and eek nature,
               And, save his lady, every creature.                   210

               To bedde he goth, and weyleth there and torneth
               In furie, as dooth he, Ixion in helle;
               And in this wyse he neigh til day soiorneth.
               But tho bigan his herte a lyte unswelle
               Thorugh teres which that gonnen up to welle;          215
               And pitously he cryde up-on Criseyde,
               And to him-self right thus he spak, and seyde: --

               `Wher is myn owene lady lief and dere,
               Wher is hir whyte brest, wher is it, where?
               Wher ben hir armes and hir eyen clere,                220
               That yesternight this tyme with me were?
               Now may I wepe allone many a tere,
               And graspe aboute I may, but in this place,
               Save a pilowe, I finde nought tenbrace.

               `How shal I do? Whan shal she com ayeyn?              225
               I noot, allas! Why leet ich hir to go?
               As wolde god, ich hadde as tho be sleyn!
               O herte myn, Criseyde, O swete fo!
               O lady myn, that I love and no mo!
               To whom for ever-mo myn herte I dowe;                 230
               See how I deye, ye nil me not rescowe!

               `Who seeth yow now, my righte lode-sterre?
               Who sit right now or stant in your presence?
               Who can conforten now your hertes werre?
               Now I am gon, whom yeve ye audience?                  235
               Who speketh for me right now in myn absence?
               Allas, no wight; and that is al my care;
               For wel wot I, as yvel as I ye fare.

               `How sholde I thus ten dayes ful endure,
               Whan I the firste night have al this tene?            240
               How shal she doon eek, sorwful creature?
               For tendernesse, how shal she this sustene,
               Swich wo for me? O pitous, pale, and grene
               Shal been your fresshe wommanliche face
               For langour, er ye torne un-to this place.'           245

               And whan he fil in any slomeringes,
               Anoon biginne he sholde for to grone,
               And dremen of the dredfulleste thinges
               That mighte been; as, mete he were allone
               In place horrible, makinge ay his mone,               250
               Or meten that he was amonges alle
               His enemys, and in hir hondes falle.

               And ther-with-al his body sholde sterte,
               And with the stert al sodeinliche awake,
               And swich a tremour fele aboute his herte,            255
               That of the feer his body sholde quake;
               And there-with-al he sholde a noyse make,
               And seme as though he sholde falle depe
               From heighe a-lofte; and than he wolde wepe,

               And rewen on him-self so pitously,                    260
               That wonder was to here his fantasye.
               Another tyme he sholde mightily
               Conforte him-self, and seyn it was folye,
               So causeles swich drede for to drye,
               And eft biginne his aspre sorwes newe,                265
               That every man mighte on his sorwes rewe.

               Who coude telle aright or ful discryve
               His wo, his pleynt, his langour, and his pyne?
               Nought al the men that han or been on-lyve.
               Thou, redere, mayst thy-self ful wel devyne           270
               That swich a wo my wit can not defyne.
               On ydel for to wryte it sholde I swinke,
               Whan that my wit is wery it to thinke.

               On hevene yet the sterres were sene,
               Al-though ful pale y-waxen was the mone;              275
               And whyten gan the orisonte shene
               Al estward, as it woned is for to done.
               And Phebus with his rosy carte sone
               Gan after that to dresse him up to fare,
               Whan Troilus hath sent after Pandare.                 280

               This Pandare, that of al the day biforn
               Ne mighte han comen Troilus to see,
               Al-though he on his heed it hadde y-sworn,
               For with the king Pryam alday was he,
               So that it lay not in his libertee                    285
               No-wher to gon, but on the morwe he wente
               To Troilus, whan that he for him sente.

               For in his herte he coude wel devyne,
               That Troilus al night for sorwe wook;
               And that he wolde telle him of his pyne,              290
               This knew he wel y-nough, with-oute book.
               For which to chaumbre streight the wey he took,
               And Troilus tho sobreliche he grette,
               And on the bed ful sone he gan him sette.

               `My Pandarus,' quod Troilus, `the sorwe               295

               Pandare answerde, and seyde, `Troilus,

               As is a man, shal drede swich ordure!                 385

               `For which with al myn herte I thee beseche,
               Un-to thy-self that al this thou foryive;
               And rys up now with-oute more speche,
               And lat us caste how forth may best be drive
               This tyme, and eek how freshly we may live            390
               Whan that she cometh, the which shal be right sone;
               God help me so, the beste is thus to done.

               `Rys, lat us speke of lusty lyf in Troye
               That we han lad, and forth the tyme dryve;
               And eek of tyme cominge us reioye,                    395
               That bringen shal our blisse now so blyve;
               And langour of these twyes dayes fyve
               We shal ther-with so foryete or oppresse,
               That wel unnethe it doon shal us duresse.

               `This toun is ful of lordes al aboute,                400
               And trewes lasten al this mene whyle.
               Go we pleye us in som lusty route
               To Sarpedon, not hennes but a myle.
               And thus thou shalt the tyme wel bigyle,
               And dryve it forth un-to that blisful morwe,          405
               That thou hir see, that cause is of thy sorwe.

               `Now rys, my dere brother Troilus;
               For certes, it noon honour is to thee
               To wepe, and in thy bedde to iouken thus.
               For trewely, of o thing trust to me,                  410
               If thou thus ligge a day, or two, or three,
               The folk wol wene that thou, for cowardyse,
               Thee feynest syk, and that thou darst not ryse.'

               This Troilus answerde, `O brother dere,
               This knowen folk that han y-suffred peyne,            415
               That though he wepe and make sorwful chere,
               That feleth harm and smert in every veyne,
               No wonder is; and though I ever pleyne,
               Or alwey wepe, I am no-thing to blame,
               Sin I have lost the cause of al my game.              420

               `But sin of fyne force I moot aryse,
               I shal aryse as sone as ever I may;
               And god, to whom myn herte I sacrifyse,
               So sende us hastely the tenthe day!
               For was ther never fowl so fayn of May,               425
               As I shal been, whan that she cometh in Troye,
               That cause is of my torment and my Ioye.

               `But whider is thy reed,' quod Troilus,
               `That we may pleye us best in al this toun?'
               `Bi god, my conseil is,' quod Pandarus,               430
               `To ryde and pleye us with king Sarpedoun.'
               So longe of this they speken up and doun,
               Til Troilus gan at the laste assente
               To ryse, and forth to Sarpedoun they wente.

               This Sarpedoun, as he that honourable                 435
               Was ever his lyve, and ful of heigh prowesse,
               With al that mighte y-served been on table,
               That deyntee was, al coste it greet richesse,
               He fedde hem day by day, that swich noblesse,
               As seyden bothe the moste and eek the leste,          440
               Was never er that day wist at any feste.

               Nor in this world ther is non instrument
               Delicious, through wind, or touche, of corde,
               As fer as any wight hath ever y-went,
               That tonge telle or herte may recorde,                445
               That at that feste it nas wel herd acorde;
               Ne of ladies eek so fayr a companye
               On daunce, er tho, was never y-seyn with ye.

               But what avayleth this to Troilus,
               That for his sorwe no-thing of it roughte?            450
               For ever in oon his herte pietous
               Ful bisily Criseyde his lady soughte.
               On hir was ever al that his herte thoughte,
               Now this, now that, so faste imagininge,
               That glade, y-wis, can him no festeyinge.             455

               These ladies eek that at this feste been,
               Sin that he saw his lady was a-weye,
               It was his sorwe upon hem for to seen,
               Or for to here on instrumentz so pleye.
               For she, that of his herte berth the keye,            460
               Was absent, lo, this was his fantasye,
               That no wight sholde make melodye.

               Nor ther nas houre in al the day or night,
               Whan he was ther-as no wight mighte him here,
               That he ne seyde, `O lufsom lady bright,              465
               How have ye faren, sin that ye were here?
               Wel-come, y-wis, myn owene lady dere.'
               But welaway, al this nas but a mase;
               Fortune his howve entended bet to glase.

               The lettres eek, that she of olde tyme                470
               Hadde him y-sent, he wolde allone rede,
               An hundred sythe, a-twixen noon and pryme;
               Refiguringe hir shap, hir womanhede,
               With-inne his herte, and every word and dede
               That passed was, and thus he droof to an ende         475
               The ferthe day, and seyde, he wolde wende.

               And seyde, `Leve brother Pandarus,
               Intendestow that we shal here bleve
               Til Sarpedoun wol forth congeyen us?
               Yet were it fairer that we toke our leve.             480
               For goddes love, lat us now sone at eve
               Our leve take, and homward lat us torne;
               For trewely, I nil not thus soiourne.'

               Pandare answerde, `Be we comen hider
               To fecchen fyr, and rennen hoom ayeyn?                485
               God helpe me so, I can not tellen whider
               We mighten goon, if I shal soothly seyn,
               Ther any wight is of us more fayn
               Than Sarpedoun; and if we hennes hye
               Thus sodeinly, I holde it vilanye.                    490

               `Sin that we seyden that we wolde bleve
               With him a wouke; and now, thus sodeinly,
               The ferthe day to take of him oure leve,
               He wolde wondren on it, trewely!
               Lat us holde forth our purpos fermely;                495
               And sin that ye bihighten him to byde,
               Hold forward now, and after lat us ryde.'

               Thus Pandarus, with alle peyne and wo,
               Made him to dwelle; and at the woukes ende,
               Of Sarpedoun they toke hir leve tho,                  500
               And on hir wey they spedden hem to wende.
               Quod Troilus, `Now god me grace sende,
               That I may finden, at myn hom-cominge,
               Criseyde comen!' And ther-with gan he singe.

               `Ye, hasel-wode!' thoughte this Pandare,              505
               And to him-self ful softely he seyde,
               `God woot, refreyden may this hote fare,
               Er Calkas sende Troilus Criseyde!'
               But natheles, he Iaped thus, and seyde,
               And swor, y-wis, his herte him wel bihighte,          510
               She wolde come as sone as ever she mighte.

               Whan they un-to the paleys were y-comen
               Of Troilus, they doun of hors alighte,
               And to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen.
               And in-to tyme that it gan to nighte,                 515
               They spaken of Crysede the brighte.
               And after this, whan that hem bothe leste,
               They spedde hem fro the soper un-to reste.

               On morwe, as sone as day bigan to clere,
               This Troilus gan of his sleep tabrayde,               520
               And to Pandare, his owene brother dere,
               `For love of god,' ful pitously he seyde,
               `As go we seen the paleys of Criseyde;
               For sin we yet may have namore feste,
               So lat us seen hir paleys at the leste.'              525

               And ther-with-al, his meyne for to blende,
               A cause he fond in toune for to go,
               And to Criseydes hous they gonnen wende.
               But lord! This sely Troilus was wo!
               Him thoughte his sorweful herte braste a-two.         530
               For whan he saugh hir dores sperred alle,
               Wel neigh for sorwe a-doun he gan to falle.

               Therwith, whan he was war and gan biholde
               How shet was every windowe of the place,
               As frost, him thoughte, his herte gan to colde;       535
               For which with chaunged deedlich pale face,
               With-outen word, he forth bigan to pace;
               And, as god wolde, he gan so faste ryde,
               That no wight of his contenance aspyde.

               Than seyde he thus; `O paleys desolat,                540
               O hous, of houses whylom best y-hight,
               O paleys empty and disconsolat,
               O thou lanterne, of which queynt is the light,
               O paleys, whylom day, that now art night,
               Wel oughtestow to falle, and I to dye,                545
               Sin she is went that wont was us to gye!

               `O paleys, whylom croune of houses alle,
               Enlumined with sonne of alle blisse!
               O ring, fro which the ruby is out-falle,
               O cause of wo, that cause hast been of lisse!         550
               Yet, sin I may no bet, fayn wolde I kisse
               Thy colde dores, dorste I for this route;
               And fare-wel shryne, of which the seynt is oute!'

               Ther-with he caste on Pandarus his ye
               With chaunged face, and pitous to biholde;            555
               And whan he mighte his tyme aright aspye,
               Ay as he rood, to Pandarus he tolde
               His newe sorwe, and eek his Ioyes olde,
               So pitously and with so dede an hewe,
               That every wight mighte on his sorwe rewe.            560

               Fro thennesforth he rydeth up and doun,
               And every thing com him to remembraunce
               As he rood forbi places of the toun
               In whiche he whylom hadde al his plesaunce.
               `Lo, yond saugh I myn owene lady daunce;              565
               And in that temple, with hir eyen clere,
               Me coughte first my righte lady dere.

               `And yonder have I herd ful lustily
               My dere herte laugh, and yonder pleye
               Saugh I hir ones eek ful blisfully.                   570
               And yonder ones to me gan she seye,
               "Now goode swete, love me wel, I preye."
               And yond so goodly gan she me biholde,
               That to the deeth myn herte is to hir holde.

               `And at that corner, in the yonder hous,              575
               Herde I myn alderlevest lady dere
               So wommanly, with voys melodious,
               Singen so wel, so goodly, and so clere,
               That in my soule yet me thinketh I here
               The blisful soun; and, in that yonder place,          580
               My lady first me took un-to hir grace.'

               Thanne thoughte he thus, `O blisful lord Cupyde,
               Whanne I the proces have in my memorie,
               How thou me hast wereyed on every syde,
               Men might a book make of it, lyk a storie.            585
               What nede is thee to seke on me victorie,
               Sin I am thyn, and hoolly at thy wille?
               What Ioye hastow thyn owene folk to spille?

               `Wel hastow, lord, y-wroke on me thyn ire,
               Thou mighty god, and dredful for to greve!            590
               Now mercy, lord, thou wost wel I desire
               Thy grace most, of alle lustes leve,
               And live and deye I wol in thy bileve,
               For which I naxe in guerdon but a bone,
               That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone.               595

               `Distreyne hir herte as faste to retorne
               As thou dost myn to longen hir to see;
               Than woot I wel, that she nil nought soiorne.
               Now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be
               Un-to the blood of Troye, I preye thee,               600
               As Iuno was un-to the blood Thebane,
               For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane.'

               And after this he to the yates wente
               Ther-as Criseyde out-rood a ful good paas,
               And up and doun ther made he many a wente,            605
               And to him-self ful ofte he seyde `Allas!
               From hennes rood my blisse and my solas!
               As wolde blisful god now, for his Ioye,
               I mighte hir seen ayein come in-to Troye!

               `And to the yonder hille I gan hir gyde,              610
               Allas! And there I took of hir my leve!
               And yond I saugh hir to hir fader ryde,
               For sorwe of which myn herte shal to-cleve.
               And hider hoom I com whan it was eve;
               And here I dwelle out-cast from alle Ioye,            615
               And shal, til I may seen hir eft in Troye.'

               And of him-self imagened he ofte
               To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse
               Than he was wont, and that men seyden softe,
               `What may it be? Who can the sothe gesse              620
               Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?'
               And al this nas but his malencolye,
               That he hadde of him-self swich fantasye.

               Another tyme imaginen he wolde
               That every wight that wente by the weye               625
               Had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde,
               `I am right sory Troilus wole deye.'
               And thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye.
               As ye have herd, swich lyf right gan he lede,
               As he that stood bitwixen hope and drede.             630

               For which him lyked in his songes shewe
               Thencheson of his wo, as he best mighte,
               And made a song of wordes but a fewe,
               Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte.
               And whan he was from every mannes sighte,             635
               With softe voys he, of his lady dere,
               That was absent, gan singe as ye may here.

               `O sterre, of which I lost have al the light,
               With herte soor wel oughte I to bewayle,
               That ever derk in torment, night by night,            640
               Toward my deeth with wind in stere I sayle;
               For which the tenthe night if that I fayle
               The gyding of thy bemes brighte an houre,
               My ship and me Caribdis wole devoure.'

               This song whan he thus songen hadde, sone             645
               He fil ayein in-to his sykes olde;
               And every night, as was his wone to done,
               He stood the brighte mone to beholde,
               And al his sorwe he to the mone tolde;
               And seyde, `Y-wis, whan thou art horned newe,         650
               I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe!

               `I saugh thyn hornes olde eek by the morwe,
               Whan hennes rood my righte lady dere,
               That cause is of my torment and my sorwe;
               For whiche, O brighte Lucina the clere,               655
               For love of god, ren faste aboute thy spere!
               For whan thyn hornes newe ginne springe,
               Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!'

               The day is more, and lenger every night,
               Than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho;            660
               And that the sonne wente his course unright
               By lenger wey than it was wont to go;
               And seyde, `Y-wis, me dredeth ever-mo,
               The sonnes sone, Pheton, be on-lyve,
               And that his fadres cart amis he dryve.'              665

               Upon the walles faste eek wolde he walke,
               And on the Grekes ost he wolde see,
               And to him-self right thus he wolde talke,
               `Lo, yonder is myn owene lady free,
               Or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be!                  670
               And thennes comth this eyr, that is so sote,
               That in my soule I fele it doth me bote.

               `And hardely this wind, that more and more
               Thus stoundemele encreseth in my face,
               Is of my ladyes depe sykes sore.                      675
               I preve it thus, for in non othere place
               Of al this toun, save onliche in this space,
               Fele I no wind that souneth so lyk peyne;
               It seyth, "Allas! Why twinned be we tweyne?"'

               This longe tyme he dryveth forth right thus,          680
               Til fully passed was the nynthe night;
               And ay bi-syde him was this Pandarus,
               That bisily dide alle his fulle might
               Him to comforte, and make his herte light;
               Yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe              685
               That she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe.

               Up-on that other syde eek was Criseyde,
               With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge;
               For which ful ofte a day `Allas,' she seyde,
               `That I was born! Wel may myn herte longe             690
               After my deeth; for now live I to longe!
               Allas! And I ne may it not amende;
               For now is wors than ever yet I wende.

               `My fader nil for no-thing do me grace
               To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme;            695
               And if so be that I my terme passe,
               My Troilus shal in his herte deme
               That I am fals, and so it may wel seme.
               Thus shal I have unthank on every syde;
               That I was born, so weylaway the tyde!                700

               `And if that I me putte in Iupartye,
               To stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle
               That I be caught, I shal be holde a spye;
               Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle,
               If in the hondes of som wrecche I falle,              705
               I am but lost, al be myn herte trewe;
               Now mighty god, thou on my sorwe rewe!'

               Ful pale y-waxen was hir brighte face,
               Hir limes lene, as she that al the day
               Stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place         710
               Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay.
               And al the night wepinge, allas! she lay.
               And thus despeired, out of alle cure,
               She ladde hir lyf, this woful creature.

               Ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse,          715
               And in hir-self she wente ay portrayinge
               Of Troilus the grete worthinesse,
               And alle his goodly wordes recordinge
               Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe.
               And thus she sette hir woful herte a-fyre             720
               Through remembraunce of that she gan desyre.

               In al this world ther nis so cruel herte
               That hir hadde herd compleynen in hir sorwe,
               That nolde han wopen for hir peynes smerte,
               So tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe.            725
               Hir nedede no teres for to borwe.
               And this was yet the worste of al hir peyne,
               Ther was no wight to whom she dorste hir pleyne.

               Ful rewfully she loked up-on Troye,
               Biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles;          730
               `Allas!' quod she, `The plesaunce and the Ioye
               The whiche that now al torned in-to galle is,
               Have I had ofte with-inne yonder walles!
               O Troilus, what dostow now,' she seyde;
               `Lord! Whether yet thou thenke up-on Criseyde?        735

               `Allas! I ne hadde trowed on your lore,
               And went with yow, as ye me radde er this!
               Thanne hadde I now not syked half so sore.
               Who mighte han seyd, that I had doon a-mis
               To stele awey with swich on as he is?                 740
               But al to late cometh the letuarie,
               Whan men the cors un-to the grave carie.

               `To late is now to speke of this matere;
               Prudence, allas! Oon of thyn eyen three
               Me lakked alwey, er that I come here;                 745
               On tyme y-passed, wel remembred me;
               And present tyme eek coude I wel y-see.
               But futur tyme, er I was in the snare,
               Coude I not seen; that causeth now my care.

               `But natheles, bityde what bityde,                    750
               I shal to-morwe at night, by est or weste,
               Out of this ost stele on som maner syde,
               And go with Troilus wher-as him leste.
               This purpos wol I holde, and this is beste.
               No fors of wikked tonges Ianglerye,                   755
               For ever on love han wrecches had envye.

               `For who-so wole of every word take hede,
               Or rewlen him by every wightes wit,
               Ne shal he never thryven, out of drede.
               For that that som men blamen ever yit,                760
               Lo, other maner folk commenden it.
               And as for me, for al swich variaunce,
               Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce.

               `For which, with-outen any wordes mo,
               To Troye I wol, as for conclusioun.'                  765
               But god it wot, er fully monthes two,
               She was ful fer fro that entencioun.
               For bothe Troilus and Troye toun
               Shal knotteles through-out hir herte slyde;
               For she wol take a purpos for tabyde.                 770

               This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan,
               Goth now, with-inne him-self ay arguinge
               With al the sleighte and al that ever he can,
               How he may best, with shortest taryinge,
               In-to his net Criseydes herte bringe.                 775
               To this entente he coude never fyne;
               To fisshen hir, he leyde out hook and lyne.

               But natheles, wel in his herte he thoughte,
               That she nas nat with-oute a love in Troye,
               For never, sithen he hir thennes broughte,            780
               Ne coude he seen her laughe or make Ioye.
               He nist how best hir herte for tacoye.
               `But for to assaye,' he seyde, `it nought ne greveth;
               For he that nought nassayeth, nought nacheveth.'

               Yet seide he to him-self upon a night,                785
               `Now am I not a fool, that woot wel how
               Hir wo for love is of another wight,
               And here-up-on to goon assaye hir now?
               I may wel wite, it nil not been my prow.
               For wyse folk in bokes it expresse,                   790
               "Men shal not wowe a wight in hevinesse."

               `But who-so mighte winnen swich a flour
               From him, for whom she morneth night and day,
               He mighte seyn, he were a conquerour.'
               And right anoon, as he that bold was ay,              795
               Thoughte in his herte, `Happe how happe may,
               Al sholde I deye, I wole hir herte seche;
               I shal no more lesen but my speche.'

               This Diomede, as bokes us declare,
               Was in his nedes prest and corageous;                 800
               With sterne voys and mighty limes square,
               Hardy, testif, strong, and chevalrous
               Of dedes, lyk his fader Tideus.
               And som men seyn, he was of tunge large;
               And heir he was of Calidoine and Arge.                805

               Criseyde mene was of hir stature,
               Ther-to of shap, of face, and eek of chere,
               Ther mighte been no fairer creature.
               And ofte tyme this was hir manere,
               To gon y-tressed with hir heres clere                 810
               Doun by hir coler at hir bak bihinde,
               Which with a threde of gold she wolde binde.

               And, save hir browes ioyneden y-fere,
               Ther nas no lak, in ought I can espyen;
               But for to speken of hir eyen clere,                  815
               Lo, trewely, they writen that hir syen,
               That Paradys stood formed in hir yen.
               And with hir riche beautee ever-more
               Strof love in hir, ay which of hem was more.

               She sobre was, eek simple, and wys with-al,           820
               The beste y-norisshed eek that mighte be,
               And goodly of hir speche in general,
               Charitable, estatliche, lusty, and free;
               Ne never-mo ne lakkede hir pitee;
               Tendre-herted, slydinge of corage;                    825
               But trewely, I can not telle hir age.

               And Troilus wel waxen was in highte,
               And complet formed by proporcioun
               So wel, that kinde it not amenden mighte;
               Yong, fresshe, strong, and hardy as lyoun;            830
               Trewe as steel in ech condicioun;
               On of the beste enteched creature,
               That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.

               And certainly in storie it is y-founde,
               That Troilus was never un-to no wight,                835
               As in his tyme, in no degree secounde
               In durring don that longeth to a knight.
               Al mighte a geaunt passen him of might,
               His herte ay with the firste and with the beste
               Stood paregal, to durre don that him leste.           840

               But for to tellen forth of Diomede: --
               It fil that after, on the tenthe day,
               Sin that Criseyde out of the citee yede,
               This Diomede, as fresshe as braunche in May,
               Com to the tente ther-as Calkas lay,                  845
               And feyned him with Calkas han to done;
               But what he mente, I shal yow telle sone.

               Criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle,
               Welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette;
               And he was ethe y-nough to maken dwelle.              850
               And after this, with-outen longe lette,
               The spyces and the wyn men forth hem fette;
               And forth they speke of this and that y-fere,
               As freendes doon, of which som shal ye here.

               He gan first fallen of the werre in speche            855
               Bitwixe hem and the folk of Troye toun;
               And of thassege he gan hir eek byseche,
               To telle him what was hir opinioun.
               Fro that demaunde he so descendeth doun
               To asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte           860
               The Grekes gyse, and werkes that they wroughte?

               And why hir fader tarieth so longe
               To wedden hir un-to som worthy wight?
               Criseyde, that was in hir peynes stronge
               For love of Troilus, hir owene knight,                865
               As fer-forth as she conning hadde or might,
               Answerde him tho; but, as of his entente,
               It semed not she wiste what he mente.

               But natheles, this ilke Diomede
               Gan in him-self assure, and thus he seyde,            870
               `If ich aright have taken of yow hede,
               Me thinketh thus, O lady myn, Criseyde,
               That sin I first hond on your brydel leyde,
               Whan ye out come of Troye by the morwe,
               Ne coude I never seen yow but in sorwe.               875

               `Can I not seyn what may the cause be
               But-if for love of som Troyan it were,
               The which right sore wolde athinken me
               That ye, for any wight that dwelleth there,
               Sholden spille a quarter of a tere,                   880
               Or pitously your-selven so bigyle;
               For dredelees, it is nought worth the whyle.

               `The folk of Troye, as who seyth, alle and some
               In preson been, as ye your-selven see;

               `And but-if Calkas lede us with ambages,
               That is to seyn, with double wordes slye,

               He knew ful wel ther shal not scapen oon

               `What wole ye more, lufsom lady dere?

               For Troye is brought in swich a Iupartye,
               That, it to save, is now no remedye.

               `And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekes finde,

               And with that word he gan to waxen reed,              925
               And in his speche a litel wight he quook,
               And caste a-syde a litel wight his heed,
               And stinte a whyle; and afterward awook,
               And sobreliche on hir he threw his look,
               And seyde, `I am, al be it yow no Ioye,               930
               As gentil man as any wight in Troye.

               `For if my fader Tydeus,' he seyde,
               `Y-lived hadde, I hadde been, er this,
               Of Calidoine and Arge a king, Criseyde!
               And so hope I that I shal yet, y-wis.                 935
               But he was slayn, allas! The more harm is,
               Unhappily at Thebes al to rathe,
               Polymites and many a man to scathe.

               `But herte myn, sin that I am your man,

               What shold I telle his wordes that he seyde?
               He spak y-now, for o day at the meste;
               It preveth wel, he spak so that Criseyde
               Graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste,
               For to speken with him at the leste,                  950
               So that he nolde speke of swich matere;
               And thus to him she seyde, as ye may here:

               As she that hadde hir herte on Troilus
               So faste, that ther may it noon arace;
               And straungely she spak, and seyde thus;              955
               `O Diomede, I love that ilke place
               Ther I was born; and Ioves, for his grace,

               `That Grekes wolde hir wraththe on Troye wreke,       960

               And god to-forn, and ferther over this,

               And that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde,           965
               So dere, I am the more un-to him holde.

               `That Grekes been of heigh condicioun,

               As worthy folk with-inne Troye toun,
               As conning, and as parfit and as kinde,               970

               And that ye coude wel your lady serve,
               I trowe eek wel, hir thank for to deserve.

               `But as to speke of love, y-wis,' she seyde,
               `I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was,                975

               What I shal after doon, I can not seye;
               But trewely, as yet me list not pleye.

               `Myn herte is now in tribulacioun,

               `To-morwe eek wol I speken with yow fayn,             995
               So that ye touchen nought of this matere.
               And whan yow list, ye may come here ayeyn;
               And, er ye gon, thus muche I seye yow here;
               As help me Pallas with hir heres clere,

               It sholde be your-selven, by my trouthe!

               `I sey not therfore that I wol yow love,

               I mene wel, by god that sit above:' --
               And ther-with-al she caste hir eyen doun,            1005
               And gan to syke, and seyde, `O Troye toun,
               Yet bidde I god, in quiete and in reste
               I may yow seen, or do myn herte breste.'

               But in effect, and shortly for to seye,
               This Diomede al freshly newe ayeyn                   1010
               Gan pressen on, and faste hir mercy preye;
               And after this, the sothe for to seyn,
               Hir glove he took, of which he was ful fayn.
               And fynally, whan it was waxen eve,
               And al was wel, he roos and took his leve.           1015

               The brighte Venus folwede and ay taughte
               The wey, ther brode Phebus doun alighte;
               And Cynthea hir char-hors over-raughte
               To whirle out of the Lyon, if she mighte;
               And Signifer his candelse shewed brighte,            1020
               Whan that Criseyde un-to hir bedde wente
               In-with hir fadres faire brighte tente.

               Retorning in hir soule ay up and doun
               The wordes of this sodein Diomede,
               His greet estat, and peril of the toun,              1025
               And that she was allone and hadde nede
               Of freendes help; and thus bigan to brede
               The cause why, the sothe for to telle,
               That she tok fully purpos for to dwelle.

               The morwe com, and goostly for to speke,             1030
               This Diomede is come un-to Criseyde,
               And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke,
               So wel he for him-selve spak and seyde,
               That alle hir sykes sore adoun he leyde.
               And fynally, the sothe for to seyne,                 1035
               He refte hir of the grete of al hir peyne.

               And after this the story telleth us,
               That she him yaf the faire baye stede,
               The which he ones wan of Troilus;
               And eek a broche (and that was litel nede)           1040
               That Troilus was, she yaf this Diomede.
               And eek, the bet from sorwe him to releve,
               She made him were a pencel of hir sleve.

               I finde eek in stories elles-where,
               Whan through the body hurt was Diomede               1045
               Of Troilus, tho weep she many a tere,
               Whan that she saugh his wyde woundes blede;
               And that she took to kepen him good hede,
               And for to hele him of his sorwes smerte.
               Men seyn, I not, that she yaf him hir herte.         1050

               But trewely, the story telleth us,
               Ther made never womman more wo
               Than she, whan that she falsed Troilus.
               She seyde, `Allas! For now is clene a-go
               My name of trouthe in love, for ever-mo!             1055
               For I have falsed oon, the gentileste
               That ever was, and oon the worthieste!

               `Allas, of me, un-to the worldes ende,
               Shal neither been y-writen nor y-songe
               No good word, for thise bokes wol me shende.         1060
               O, rolled shal I been on many a tonge;
               Through-out the world my belle shal be ronge;
               And wommen most wol hate me of alle.
               Allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle!

               `They wol seyn, in as muche as in me is,             1065
               I have hem don dishonour, weylawey!
               Al be I not the first that dide amis,
               What helpeth that to do my blame awey?
               But sin I see there is no bettre way,
               And that to late is now for me to rewe,              1070
               To Diomede algate I wol be trewe.

               `But Troilus, sin I no better may,
               And sin that thus departen ye and I,
               Yet preye I god, so yeve yow right good day
               As for the gentileste, trewely,                      1075
               That ever I say, to serven feithfully,
               And best can ay his lady honour kepe:' --
               And with that word she brast anon to wepe.

               `And certes yow ne haten shal I never,
               And freendes love, that shal ye han of me,           1080
               And my good word, al mighte I liven ever.
               And, trewely, I wolde sory be
               For to seen yow in adversitee.
               And giltelees, I woot wel, I yow leve;
               But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.'         1085

               But trewely, how longe it was bitwene,
               That she for-sook him for this Diomede,
               Ther is non auctor telleth it, I wene.
               Take every man now to his bokes hede;
               He shal no terme finden, out of drede.               1090
               For though that he bigan to wowe hir sone,
               Er he hir wan, yet was ther more to done.

               Ne me ne list this sely womman chyde
               Ferther than the story wol devyse.
               Hir name, allas! Is publisshed so wyde,              1095
               That for hir gilt it oughte y-noe suffyse.
               And if I mighte excuse hir any wyse,
               For she so sory was for hir untrouthe,
               Y-wis, I wolde excuse hir yet for routhe.

               This Troilus, as I biforn have told,                 1100
               Thus dryveth forth, as wel as he hath might.
               But often was his herte hoot and cold,
               And namely, that ilke nynthe night,
               Which on the morwe she hadde him byhight
               To come ayein: god wot, ful litel reste              1105
               Hadde he that night; no-thing to slepe him leste.

               The laurer-crouned Phebus, with his hete,
               Gan, in his course ay upward as he wente,
               To warmen of the est see the wawes wete,
               And Nisus doughter song with fresh entente,          1110
               Whan Troilus his Pandare after sente;
               And on the walles of the toun they pleyde,
               To loke if they can seen ought of Criseyde.

               Til it was noon, they stoden for to see
               Who that ther come; and every maner wight,           1115
               That cam fro fer, they seyden it was she,
               Til that they coude knowen him a-right.
               Now was his herte dul, now was it light;
               And thus by-iaped stonden for to stare
               Aboute nought, this Troilus and Pandare.             1120

               To Pandarus this Troilus tho seyde,
               `For ought I wot, bi-for noon, sikerly,
               In-to this toun ne comth nought here Criseyde.
               She hath y-now to done, hardily,
               To winnen from hir fader, so trowe I;                1125
               Hir olde fader wol yet make hir dyne
               Er that she go; god yeve his herte pyne!'

               Pandare answerde, `It may wel be, certeyn;
               And for-thy lat us dyne, I thee biseche;
               And after noon than maystw thou come ayeyn.'         1130
               And hoom they go, with-oute more speche;
               And comen ayein, but longe may they seche
               Er that they finde that they after cape;
               Fortune hem bothe thenketh for to Iape.

               Quod Troilus, `I see wel now, that she               1135

               That er she come, it wole neigh even be.
               Com forth, I wol un-to the yate go.
               Thise portours been unkonninge ever-mo;
               And I wol doon hem holden up the yate                1140
               As nought ne were, al-though she come late.'

               The day goth faste, and after that comth eve,
               And yet com nought to Troilus Criseyde.
               He loketh forth by hegge, by tree, by greve,
               And fer his heed over the wal he leyde.              1145
               And at the laste he torned him, and seyde.
               `By god, I woot hir mening now, Pandare!
               Al-most, y-wis, al newe was my care.

               `Now douteles, this lady can hir good;
               I woot, she meneth ryden prively.                    1150
               I comende hir wysdom, by myn hood!
               She wol not maken peple nycely
               Gaure on hir, whan she comth; but softely
               By nighte in-to the toun she thenketh ryde.
               And, dere brother, thenk not longe to abyde.         1155

               `We han nought elles for to don, y-wis.
               And Pandarus, now woltow trowen me?
               Have here my trouthe, I see hir! Yond she is.
               Heve up thyn eyen, man! Maystow not see?'
               Pandare answerde, `Nay, so mote I thee!              1160
               Al wrong, by god; what seystow, man, wher art?
               That I see yond nis but a fare-cart.'

               `Allas, thou seist right sooth,' quod Troilus;
               `But, hardely, it is not al for nought
               That in myn herte I now reioyse thus.                1165
               It is ayein som good I have a thought.
               Noot I not how, but sin that I was wrought,
               Ne felte I swich a confort, dar I seye;
               She comth to-night, my lyf, that dorste I leye!'

               Pandare answerde, `It may be wel, y-nough';          1170
               And held with him of al that ever he seyde;
               But in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough,
               And to him-self ful sobrely he seyde:
               `From hasel-wode, ther Ioly Robin pleyde,
               Shal come al that thou abydest here;                 1175
               Ye, fare-wel al the snow of ferne yere!'

               The wardein of the yates gan to calle
               The folk which that with-oute the yates were,
               And bad hem dryven in hir bestes alle,
               Or al the night they moste bleven there.             1180
               And fer with-in the night, with many a tere,
               This Troilus gan hoomward for to ryde;
               For wel he seeth it helpeth nought tabyde.

               But natheles, he gladded him in this;
               He thoughte he misacounted hadde his day,            1185
               And seyde, `I understonde have al a-mis.
               For thilke night I last Criseyde say,
               She seyde, "I shal ben here, if that I may,
               Er that the mone, O dere herte swete!
               The Lyon passe, out of this Ariete."                 1190

               `For which she may yet holde al hir biheste.'
               And on the morwe un-to the yate he wente,
               And up and down, by west and eek by este,
               Up-on the walles made he many a wente.
               But al for nought; his hope alwey him blente;        1195
               For which at night, in sorwe and sykes sore,
               He wente him hoom, with-outen any more.

               This hope al clene out of his herte fledde,
               He nath wher-on now lenger for to honge;
               But for the peyne him thoughte his herte bledde,     1200
               So were his throwes sharpe and wonder stronge.
               For when he saugh that she abood so longe,
               He niste what he iuggen of it mighte,
               Sin she hath broken that she him bihighte.

               The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day                1205
               After tho dayes ten, of which I tolde,
               Bitwixen hope and drede his herte lay,
               Yet som-what trustinge on hir hestes olde.
               But whan he saugh she nolde hir terme holde,
               He can now seen non other remedye,                   1210
               But for to shape him sone for to dye.

               Ther-with the wikked spirit, god us blesse,
               Which that men clepeth wode Ialousye,
               Gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse;
               For which, by-cause he wolde sone dye,               1215
               He ne eet ne dronk, for his malencolye,
               And eek from every companye he fledde;
               This was the lyf that al the tyme he ledde.

               He so defet was, that no maner man
               Unneth mighte him knowe ther he wente;               1220
               So was he lene, and ther-to pale and wan,
               And feble, that he walketh by potente;
               And with his ire he thus himselven shente.
               But who-so axed him wher-of him smerte,
               He seyde, his harm was al aboute his herte.          1225

               Pryam ful ofte, and eek his moder dere,
               His bretheren and his sustren gonne him freyne
               Why he so sorwful was in al his chere,
               And what thing was the cause of al his peyne?
               But al for nought; he nolde his cause pleyne,        1230
               But seyde, he felte a grevous maladye
               A-boute his herte, and fayn he wolde dye.

               So on a day he leyde him doun to slepe,
               And so bifel that in his sleep him thoughte,
               That in a forest faste he welk to wepe               1235
               For love of hir that him these peynes wroughte;
               And up and doun as he the forest soughte,
               He mette he saugh a boor with tuskes grete,
               That sleep ayein the brighte sonnes hete.

               And by this boor, faste in his armes folde,          1240
               Lay kissing ay his lady bright Criseyde:
               For sorwe of which, whan he it gan biholde,
               And for despyt, out of his slepe he breyde,
               And loude he cryde on Pandarus, and seyde,
               `O Pandarus, now knowe I crop and rote!              1245
               I nam but deed; ther nis non other bote!

               `My lady bright Criseyde hath me bitrayed,
               In whom I trusted most of any wight,
               She elles-where hath now hir herte apayed;
               The blisful goddes, through hir grete might,         1250
               Han in my dreem y-shewed it ful right.
               Thus in my dreem Criseyde I have biholde' --
               And al this thing to Pandarus he tolde.

               `O my Criseyde, allas! What subtiltee.
               What newe lust, what beautee, what science,          1255
               What wratthe of iuste cause have ye to me?
               What gilt of me, what fel experience
               Hath fro me raft, allas! Thyn advertence?
               O trust, O feyth, O depe aseuraunce,
               Who hath me reft Criseyde, al my plesaunce?          1260

               `Allas! Why leet I you from hennes go,
               For which wel neigh out of my wit I breyde?
               Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?
               God wot I wende, O lady bright, Criseyde,
               That every word was gospel that ye seyde!            1265
               But who may bet bigylen, yf him liste,
               Than he on whom men weneth best to triste?

               `What shal I doon, my Pandarus, allas!
               I fele now so sharpe a newe peyne,
               Sin that ther is no remedie in this cas,             1270
               That bet were it I with myn hondes tweyne
               My-selven slow, than alwey thus to pleyne.
               For through my deeth my wo sholde han an ende,
               Ther every day with lyf my-self I shende.'

               Pandare answerde and seyde, `Allas the whyle         1275
               That I was born; have I not seyd er this,
               That dremes many a maner man bigyle?
               And why? For folk expounden hem a-mis.
               How darstow seyn that fals thy lady is,
               For any dreem, right for thyn owene drede?           1280
               Lat be this thought, thou canst no dremes rede.

               `Paraunter, ther thou dremest of this boor,

               `How mighte I thanne do?' quod Troilus,
               `To knowe of this, ye, were it never so lyte?'       1290
               `Now seystow wysly,' quod this Pandarus,

               To knowe a sooth of that thou art in doute.          1295

               `And see now why; for this I dar wel seyn,

               Acorded been to this conclusioun,                    1310

               This lettre forth was sent un-to Criseyde,
               Of which hir answere in effect was this;
               Ful pitously she wroot ayein, and seyde,

               And fynally she wroot and seyde him thanne,
               She wolde come, ye, but she niste whenne.

               But in hir lettre made she swich festes,
               That wonder was, and swereth she loveth him best,    1430
               Of which he fond but botmelees bihestes.
               But Troilus, thou mayst now, est or west,

               Thus gooth the world; god shilde us fro mischaunce,
               And every wight that meneth trouthe avaunce!         1435

               Encresen gan the wo fro day to night
               Of Troilus, for taryinge of Criseyde;
               And lessen gan his hope and eek his might,
               For which al doun he in his bed him leyde;
               He ne eet, ne dronk, ne sleep, ne word he seyde,     1440
               Imagininge ay that she was unkinde;
               For which wel neigh he wex out of his minde.

               This dreem, of which I told have eek biforn,
               May never come out of his remembraunce;
               He thoughte ay wel he hadde his lady lorn,           1445
               And that Ioves, of his purveyaunce,
               Him shewed hadde in sleep the signifiaunce
               Of hir untrouthe and his disaventure,
               And that the boor was shewed him in figure.

               For which he for Sibille his suster sente,           1450
               That called was Cassandre eek al aboute;
               And al his dreem he tolde hir er he stente,
               And hir bisoughte assoilen him the doute
               Of the stronge boor, with tuskes stoute;
               And fynally, with-inne a litel stounde,              1455
               Cassandre him gan right thus his dreem expounde.

               She gan first smyle, and seyde, `O brother dere,

               Wrak hir in a wonder cruel wyse.
               For with a boor as greet as oxe in stalle
               She made up frete hir corn and vynes alle.           1470

               `To slee this boor was al the contree reysed,

               That with his manhod, er he wolde stente,
               This boor he slow, and hir the heed he sente;

               `Of which, as olde bokes tellen us,

               And of this lord descended Tydeus                    1480

               Fortune, whiche that permutacioun
               Of thinges hath, as it is hir committed

               But on a day to fighten gan he wende,
               At which, allas! He coughte his lyves ende.

               For which me thinketh every maner wight              1555
               That haunteth armes oughte to biwayle
               The deeth of him that was so noble a knight;
               For as he drough a king by thaventayle,
               Unwar of this, Achilles through the mayle
               And through the body gan him for to ryve;            1560
               And thus this worthy knight was brought of lyve.

               For whom, as olde bokes tellen us,
               Was mad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle;
               And namely, the sorwe of Troilus,
               That next him was of worthinesse welle.              1565
               And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle,
               That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste,
               Ful ofte a day he bad his herte breste.

               But natheles, though he gan him dispeyre,
               And dradde ay that his lady was untrewe,             1570
               Yet ay on hir his herte gan repeyre.
               And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe
               To gete ayein Criseyde, bright of hewe.
               And in his herte he wente hir excusinge,
               That Calkas causede al hir taryinge.                 1575

               And ofte tyme he was in purpos grete
               Him-selven lyk a pilgrim to disgyse,
               To seen hir; but he may not contrefete
               To been unknowen of folk that weren wyse,
               Ne finde excuse aright that may suffyse,             1580
               If he among the Grekes knowen were;
               For which he weep ful ofte many a tere.

               To hir he wroot yet ofte tyme al newe
               Ful pitously, he lefte it nought for slouthe,
               Biseching hir that, sin that he was trewe,           1585
               She wolde come ayein and holde hir trouthe.
               For which Criseyde up-on a day, for routhe,

               `Yet preye I yow on yvel ye ne take,                 1625
               That it is short which that I to yow wryte;
               I dar not, ther I am, wel lettres make,
               Ne never yet ne coude I wel endyte.
               Eek greet effect men wryte in place lite.
               Thentente is al, and nought the lettres space;       1630
               And fareth now wel, god have you in his grace!
                                                La vostre C.'

               This Troilus this lettre thoughte al straunge,
               Whan he it saugh, and sorwefully he sighte;
               Him thoughte it lyk a kalendes of chaunge;
               But fynally, he ful ne trowen mighte                 1635
               That she ne wolde him holden that she highte;
               For with ful yvel wil list him to leve
               That loveth wel, in swich cas, though him greve.

               But natheles, men seyn that, at the laste,
               For any thing, men shal the sothe see;               1640
               And swich a cas bitidde, and that as faste,
               That Troilus wel understood that she
               Nas not so kinde as that hir oughte be.
               And fynally, he woot now, out of doute,
               That al is lost that he hath been aboute.            1645

               Stood on a day in his malencolye
               This Troilus, and in suspecioun
               Of hir for whom he wende for to dye.
               And so bifel, that through-out Troye toun,
               As was the gyse, y-bore was up and doun              1650
               A maner cote-armure, as seyth the storie,
               Biforn Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie,

               The whiche cote, as telleth Lollius,
               Deiphebe it hadde y-rent from Diomede
               The same day; and whan this Troilus                  1655
               It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede,
               Avysing of the lengthe and of the brede,
               And al the werk; but as he gan biholde,
               Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde,

               As he that on the coler fond with-inne               1660
               A broche, that he Criseyde yaf that morwe
               That she from Troye moste nedes twinne,
               In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe;
               And she him leyde ayein hir feyth to borwe
               To kepe it ay; but now, ful wel he wiste,            1665
               His lady nas no lenger on to triste.

               He gooth him hoom, and gan ful sone sende
               For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce,
               And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende,
               Compleyninge of hir hertes variaunce,                1670
               His longe love, his trouthe, and his penaunce;
               And after deeth, with-outen wordes more,
               Ful faste he cryde, his reste him to restore.

               Than spak he thus, `O lady myn Criseyde,
               Wher is your feyth, and wher is your biheste?        1675
               Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe,' he seyde;
               `Of Diomede have ye now al this feste!
               Allas, I wolde have trowed at the leste.
               That, sin ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde,
               That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde!           1680

               `Who shal now trowe on any othes mo?
               Allas, I never wolde han wend, er this,
               That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so;
               Ne, but I hadde a-gilt and doon amis,
               So cruel wende I not your herte, y-wis,              1685
               To slee me thus; allas, your name of trouthe
               Is now for-doon, and that is al my routhe.

               `Was ther non other broche yow liste lete
               To feffe with your newe love,' quod he,
               `But thilke broche that I, with teres wete,          1690
               Yow yaf, as for a remembraunce of me?
               Non other cause, allas, ne hadde ye
               But for despyt, and eek for that ye mente
               Al-outrely to shewen your entente!

               `Through which I see that clene out of your minde    1695
               Ye han me cast, and I ne can nor may,
               For al this world, with-in myn herte finde
               To unloven yow a quarter of a day!
               In cursed tyme I born was, weylaway!
               That ye, that doon me al this wo endure,             1700
               Yet love I best of any creature.

               `Now god,' quod he, `me sende yet the grace
               That I may meten with this Diomede!
               And trewely, if I have might and space,
               Yet shal I make, I hope, his sydes blede.            1705
               O god,' quod he, `that oughtest taken hede
               To fortheren trouthe, and wronges to punyce,
               Why niltow doon a vengeaunce of this vyce?

               `O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste
               Me blamed hast, and wont art oft up-breyde,          1710
               Now maystow see thy-selve, if that thee liste,
               How trewe is now thy nece, bright Criseyde!
               In sondry formes, god it woot,' he seyde,
               `The goddes shewen bothe Ioye and tene
               In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene.            1715

               `And certaynly, with-oute more speche,
               From hennes-forth, as ferforth as I may,
               Myn owene deeth in armes wol I seche;
               I recche not how sone be the day!
               But trewely, Criseyde, swete may,                    1720
               Whom I have ay with al my might y-served,
               That ye thus doon, I have it nought deserved.'

               This Pandarus, that alle these thinges herde,
               And wiste wel he seyde a sooth of this,
               He nought a word ayein to him answerde;              1725
               For sory of his frendes sorwe he is,
               And shamed, for his nece hath doon a-mis;
               And stant, astoned of these causes tweye,
               As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye.

               But at the laste thus he spak, and seyde,            1730
               `My brother dere, I may thee do no-more.
               What shulde I seyn? I hate, y-wis, Criseyde!
               And, god wot, I wol hate hir evermore!
               And that thou me bisoughtest doon of yore,
               Havinge un-to myn honour ne my reste                 1735
               Right no reward, I dide al that thee leste.

               `If I dide ought that mighte lyken thee,
               It is me leef; and of this treson now,
               God woot, that it a sorwe is un-to me!
               And dredelees, for hertes ese of yow,                1740
               Right fayn wolde I amende it, wiste I how.
               And fro this world, almighty god I preye,
               Delivere hir sone; I can no-more seye.'

               Gret was the sorwe and pleynt of Troilus;
               But forth hir cours fortune ay gan to holde.         1745
               Criseyde loveth the sone of Tydeus,
               And Troilus mot wepe in cares colde.
               Swich is this world; who-so it can biholde,
               In eche estat is litel hertes reste;
               God leve us for to take it for the beste!            1750

               In many cruel batayle, out of drede,
               Of Troilus, this ilke noble knight,
               As men may in these olde bokes rede,
               Was sene his knighthod and his grete might.
               And dredelees, his ire, day and night,               1755
               Ful cruelly the Grekes ay aboughte;
               And alwey most this Diomede he soughte.

               And ofte tyme, I finde that they mette
               With blody strokes and with wordes grete,
               Assayinge how hir speres weren whette;               1760
               And god it woot, with many a cruel hete
               Gan Troilus upon his helm to bete.
               But natheles, fortune it nought ne wolde,
               Of others hond that either deyen sholde. --

               And if I hadde y-taken for to wryte                  1765
               The armes of this ilke worthy man,
               Than wolde I of his batailles endyte.
               But for that I to wryte first bigan
               Of his love, I have seyd as that I can.
               His worthy dedes, who-so list hem here,              1770
               Reed Dares, he can telle hem alle y-fere.

               Bisechinge every lady bright of hewe,
               And every gentil womman, what she be,
               That al be that Criseyde was untrewe,
               That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me.        1775
               Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see;
               And gladlier I wole wryten, if yow leste,
               Penolopees trouthe and good Alceste.

               Ne I sey not this al-only for these men,
               But most for wommen that bitraysed be                1780
               Through false folk; god yeve hem sorwe, amen!
               That with hir grete wit and subtiltee
               Bitrayse yow! And this commeveth me
               To speke, and in effect yow alle I preye,
               Beth war of men, and herkeneth what I seye! --       1785

               Go, litel book, go litel myn tragedie,
               Ther god thy maker yet, er that he dye,
               So sende might to make in som comedie!
               But litel book, no making thou nenvye,
               But subgit be to alle poesye;                        1790
               And kis the steppes, wher-as thou seest pace
               Virgile, Ovyde, Omer, Lucan, and Stace.

               And for ther is so greet diversitee
               In English and in wryting of our tonge,
               So preye I god that noon miswryte thee,              1795
               Ne thee mismetre for defaute of tonge.
               And red wher-so thou be, or elles songe,
               That thou be understonde I god beseche!
               But yet to purpos of my rather speche. --

               The wraththe, as I began yow for to seye,            1800
               Of Troilus, the Grekes boughten dere;
               For thousandes his hondes maden deye,
               As he that was with-outen any pere,
               Save Ector, in his tyme, as I can here.
               But weylawey, save only goddes wille,                1805
               Dispitously him slough the fiers Achille.

               And whan that he was slayn in this manere,
               His lighte goost ful blisfully is went
               Up to the holownesse of the seventh spere,
               In convers letinge every element;                    1810
               And ther he saugh, with ful avysement,
               The erratik sterres, herkeninge armonye
               With sownes fulle of hevenish melodye.

               And doun from thennes faste he gan avyse
               This litel spot of erthe, that with the see          1815
               Embraced is, and fully gan despyse
               This wrecched world, and held al vanitee
               To respect of the pleyn felicitee
               That is in hevene above; and at the laste,
               Ther he was slayn, his loking doun he caste;         1820

               And in him-self he lough right at the wo
               Of hem that wepten for his deeth so faste;
               And dampned al our werk that folweth so
               The blinde lust, the which that may not laste,
               And sholden al our herte on hevene caste.            1825
               And forth he wente, shortly for to telle,
               Ther as Mercurie sorted him to dwelle. --

               Swich fyn hath, lo, this Troilus for love,
               Swich fyn hath al his grete worthinesse;
               Swich fyn hath his estat real above,                 1830
               Swich fyn his lust, swich fyn hath his noblesse;
               Swich fyn hath false worldes brotelnesse.
               And thus bigan his lovinge of Criseyde,
               As I have told, and in this wyse he deyde.

               O yonge fresshe folkes, he or she,                   1835
               In which that love up groweth with your age,
               Repeyreth hoom from worldly vanitee,
               And of your herte up-casteth the visage
               To thilke god that after his image
               Yow made, and thinketh al nis but a fayre            1840
               This world, that passeth sone as floures fayre.

               And loveth him, the which that right for love
               Upon a cros, our soules for to beye,
               First starf, and roos, and sit in hevene a-bove;
               For he nil falsen no wight, dar I seye,              1845
               That wol his herte al hoolly on him leye.
               And sin he best to love is, and most meke,
               What nedeth feyned loves for to seke?

               Lo here, of Payens corsed olde rytes,
               Lo here, what alle hir goddes may availle;           1850
               Lo here, these wrecched worldes appetytes;
               Lo here, the fyn and guerdon for travaille
               Of Iove, Appollo, of Mars, of swich rascaille!
               Lo here, the forme of olde clerkes speche
               In poetrye, if ye hir bokes seche. --                1855

               O moral Gower, this book I directe
               To thee, and to the philosophical Strode,
               To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to corecte,
               Of your benignitees and zeles gode.
               And to that sothfast Crist, that starf on rode,      1860
               With al myn herte of mercy ever I preye;
               And to the lord right thus I speke and seye:

               Thou oon, and two, and three, eterne on-lyve,
               That regnest ay in three and two and oon,
               Uncircumscript, and al mayst circumscryve,           1865
               Us from visible and invisible foon
               Defende; and to thy mercy, everichoon,
               So make us, Iesus, for thy grace digne,
               For love of mayde and moder thyn benigne! Amen.
