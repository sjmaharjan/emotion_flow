AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE




ACT I


(SCENE.--DR. STOCKMANN'S sitting-room. It is evening. The room is
plainly but neatly appointed and furnished. In the right-hand wall are
two doors; the farther leads out to the hall, the nearer to the
doctor's study. In the left-hand wall, opposite the door leading to the
hall, is a door leading to the other rooms occupied by the family. In
the middle of the same wall stands the stove, and, further forward, a
couch with a looking-glass hanging over it and an oval table in front
of it. On the table, a lighted lamp, with a lampshade. At the back of
the room, an open door leads to the dining-room. BILLING is seen
sitting at the dining table, on which a lamp is burning. He has a
napkin tucked under his chin, and MRS. STOCKMANN is standing by the
table handing him a large plate-full of roast beef. The other places at
the table are empty, and the table somewhat in disorder, evidently a
meal having recently been finished.) Mrs. Stockmann. You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you
have to put up with cold meat. Billing (as he eats). It is uncommonly good, thank you--remarkably good. Mrs. Stockmann. My husband makes such a point of having his meals
punctually, you know. Billing. That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a
meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and
undisturbed. Mrs. Stockmann. Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it--. (Turns to
the hall door, listening.) I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too. Billing. Very likely. (PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,
and carries a stick.) Peter Stockmann. Good evening, Katherine. Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
evening--is it you? How good of you to come up and see us! Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so--(looks into the
dining-room). But you have company with you, I see. Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no--it was quite by chance
he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too? Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious--hot meat at night! Not with my digestion. Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way--

Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run--and a little more
economical, too. Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
spendthrifts. Peter Stockmann. Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you. (Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home? Mrs. Stockmann. No, he went out for a little turn after supper--he and
the boys. Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I
fancy I hear him coming now. Mrs. Stockmann. No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the
door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.
Hovstad! Hovstad. Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Peter Stockmann (bowing a little distantly). Good evening. You have
come on business, no doubt. Hovstad. Partly. It's about an article for the paper. Peter Stockmann. So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific
contributor to the "People's Messenger." Hovstad. Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger"
when he has any home truths to tell. Mrs. Stockmann (to HOVSTAD). But won't you--? (Points to the
dining-room.) Peter Stockmann. Quite so, quite so. I don't blame him in the least, as
a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the
readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to
bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad. Hovstad. I quite agree with you. Peter Stockmann. Taking one thing with another, there is an excellent
spirit of toleration in the town--an admirable municipal spirit. And it
all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to
unite us--an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of
every right-minded citizen. Hovstad. The Baths, yes. Peter Stockmann. Exactly---our fine, new, handsome Baths. Mark my
words, Mr. Hovstad--the Baths will become the focus of our municipal
life! Not a doubt of it! Mrs. Stockmann. That is just what Thomas says. Peter Stockmann. Think how extraordinarily the place has developed
within the last year or two! Money has been flowing in, and there is
some life and some business doing in the town. Houses and landed
property are rising in value every day. Hovstad. And unemployment is diminishing,

Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is another thing. The burden on the poor
rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied
classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really
good summer this year, and lots of visitors--plenty of invalids, who
will make the Baths talked about. Hovstad. And there is a good prospect of that, I hear. Peter Stockmann. It looks very promising. Inquiries about apartments
and that sort of thing are reaching us, every day. Hovstad. Well, the doctor's article will come in very suitably. Peter Stockmann. Has he been writing something just lately? Hovstad. This is something he wrote in the winter; a recommendation of
the Baths--an account of the excellent sanitary conditions here. But I
held the article over, temporarily. Peter Stockmann. Ah,--some little difficulty about it, I suppose? Hovstad. No, not at all; I thought it would be better to wait until the
spring, because it is just at this time that people begin to think
seriously about their summer quarters. Peter Stockmann. Quite right; you were perfectly right, Mr. Hovstad. Hovstad. Yes, Thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of
the Baths. Peter Stockmann. Well remember, he is the Medical Officer to the Baths. Hovstad. Yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him. Peter Stockmann. To him? Indeed! It is true I have heard from time to
time that some people are of that opinion. At the same time I must say
I imagined that I took a modest part in the enterprise. Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is what Thomas is always saying. Hovstad. But who denies it, Mr. Stockmann? You set the thing going and
made a practical concern of it; we all know that. I only meant that the
idea of it came first from the doctor. Peter Stockmann. Oh, ideas yes! My brother has had plenty of them in
his time--unfortunately. But when it is a question of putting an idea
into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle. Mr. Hovstad. And I certainly should have thought that in this house at
least...

Mrs. Stockmann. My dear Peter--

Hovstad. How can you think that--? Mrs. Stockmann. Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My
husband is sure to be back directly. Hovstad. Thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (Goes into the dining-room.) Peter Stockmann (lowering his voice a little). It is a curious thing
that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact. Mrs. Stockmann. Surely it is not worth bothering about! Cannot you and
Thomas share the credit as brothers? Peter Stockmann. I should have thought so; but apparently some people
are not satisfied with a share. Mrs. Stockmann. What nonsense! You and Thomas get on so capitally
together. (Listens.) There he is at last, I think. (Goes out and opens
the door leading to the hall.) Dr. Stockmann (laughing and talking outside). Look here--here is
another guest for you, Katherine. Isn't that jolly! Come in, Captain
Horster; hang your coat up on this peg. Ah, you don't wear an overcoat. Just think, Katherine; I met him in the street and could hardly
persuade him to come up! (CAPTAIN HORSTER comes into the room and
greets MRS. STOCKMANN. He is followed by DR. STOCKMANN.) Come along in,
boys. They are ravenously hungry again, you know. Come along, Captain
Horster; you must have a slice of beef. (Pushes HORSTER into the
dining-room. EJLIF and MORTEN go in after them.) Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas, don't you see--? Dr. Stockmann (turning in the doorway). Oh, is it you, Peter? (Shakes
hands with him.) Now that is very delightful. Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately I must go in a moment--

Dr. Stockmann. Rubbish! There is some toddy just coming in. You haven't
forgotten the toddy, Katherine? Mrs. Stockmann. Of course not; the water is boiling now. (Goes into the
dining-room.) Peter Stockmann. Toddy too! Dr. Stockmann. Yes, sit down and we will have it comfortably. Peter Stockmann. Thanks, I never care about an evening's drinking. Dr. Stockmann. But this isn't an evening's drinking. Peter Stockmann. It seems to me--. (Looks towards the dining-room.) It
is extraordinary how they can put away all that food. Dr. Stockmann (rubbing his hands). Yes, isn't it splendid to see young
people eat? They have always got an appetite, you know! That's as it
should be. Lots of food--to build up their strength! They are the
people who are going to stir up the fermenting forces of the future,
Peter. Peter Stockmann. May I ask what they will find here to "stir up," as
you put it? Dr. Stockmann. Ah, you must ask the young people that--when the times
comes. We shan't be able to see it, of course. That stands to
reason--two old fogies, like us. Peter Stockmann. Really, really! I must say that is an extremely odd
expression to--

Dr. Stockmann. Oh, you mustn't take me too literally, Peter. I am so
heartily happy and contented, you know. I think it is such an
extraordinary piece of good fortune to be in the middle of all this
growing, germinating life. It is a splendid time to live in! It is as
if a whole new world were being created around one. Peter Stockmann. Do you really think so? Dr. Stockmann. Ah, naturally you can't appreciate it as keenly as I. You have lived all your life in these surroundings, and your
impressions have been blunted. But I, who have been buried all these
years in my little corner up north, almost without ever seeing a
stranger who might bring new ideas with him--well, in my case it has
just the same effect as if I had been transported into the middle of a
crowded city. Peter Stockmann. Oh, a city--! Dr. Stockmann. I know, I know; it is all cramped enough here, compared
with many other places. But there is life here--there is promise--there
are innumerable things to work for and fight for; and that is the main
thing. (Calls.) Katherine, hasn't the postman been here? Mrs. Stockmann (from the dining-room). No. Dr. Stockmann. And then to be comfortably off, Peter! That is something
one learns to value, when one has been on the brink of starvation, as
we have. Peter Stockmann. Oh, surely--

Dr. Stockmann. Indeed I can assure you we have often been very hard put
to it, up there. And now to be able to live like a lord! Today, for
instance, we had roast beef for dinner--and, what is more, for supper
too. Won't you come and have a little bit? Or let me show it you, at
any rate? Come here--

Peter Stockmann. No, no--not for worlds! Dr. Stockmann. Well, but just come here then. Do you see, we have got a
table-cover? Peter Stockmann. Yes, I noticed it. Dr. Stockmann. And we have got a lamp-shade too. Do you see? All out of
Katherine's savings! It makes the room so cosy. Don't you think so? Just stand here for a moment--no, no, not there--just here, that's it! Look now, when you get the light on it altogether. I really think it
looks very nice, doesn't it? Peter Stockmann. Oh, if you can afford luxuries of this kind--

Dr. Stockmann. Yes, I can afford it now. Katherine tells me I earn
almost as much as we spend. Peter Stockmann. Almost--yes! Dr. Stockmann. But a scientific man must live in a little bit of style. I am quite sure an ordinary civil servant spends more in a year than I
do. Peter Stockmann. I daresay. A civil servant--a man in a well-paid
position...

Dr. Stockmann. Well, any ordinary merchant, then! A man in that
position spends two or three times as much as--

Peter Stockmann. It just depends on circumstances. Dr. Stockmann. At all events I assure you I don't waste money
unprofitably. But I can't find it in my heart to deny myself the
pleasure of entertaining my friends. I need that sort of thing, you
know. I have lived for so long shut out of it all, that it is a
necessity of life to me to mix with young, eager, ambitious men, men of
liberal and active minds; and that describes every one of those fellows
who are enjoying their supper in there. I wish you knew more of Hovstad. Peter Stockmann. By the way, Hovstad was telling me he was going to
print another article of yours. Dr. Stockmann. An article of mine? Peter Stockmann. Yes, about the Baths. An article you wrote in the
winter. Dr. Stockmann. Oh, that one! No, I don't intend that to appear just for
the present. Peter Stockmann. Why not? It seems to me that this would be the most
opportune moment. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, very likely--under normal conditions. (Crosses the
room.) Peter Stockmann (following him with his eyes). Is there anything
abnormal about the present conditions? Dr. Stockmann (standing still). To tell you the truth, Peter, I can't
say just at this moment--at all events not tonight. There may be much
that is very abnormal about the present conditions--and it is possible
there may be nothing abnormal about them at all. It is quite possible
it may be merely my imagination. Peter Stockmann. I must say it all sounds most mysterious. Is there
something going on that I am to be kept in ignorance of? I should have
imagined that I, as Chairman of the governing body of the Baths--

Dr. Stockmann. And I should have imagined that I--. Oh, come, don't let
us fly out at one another, Peter. Peter Stockmann. Heaven forbid! I am not in the habit of flying out at
people, as you call it. But I am entitled to request most emphatically
that all arrangements shall be made in a businesslike manner, through
the proper channels, and shall be dealt with by the legally constituted
authorities. I can allow no going behind our backs by any roundabout
means. Dr. Stockmann. Have I ever at any time tried to go behind your backs? Peter Stockmann. You have an ingrained tendency to take your own way,
at all events; and, that is almost equally inadmissible in a well
ordered community, The individual ought undoubtedly to acquiesce in
subordinating himself to the community--or, to speak more accurately,
to the authorities who have the care of the community's welfare. Dr. Stockmann. Very likely. But what the deuce has all this got to do
with me? Peter Stockmann. That is exactly what you never appear to be willing to
learn, my dear Thomas. But, mark my words, some day you will have to
suffer for it--sooner or later. Now I have told you. Good-bye. Dr. Stockmann. Have you taken leave of your senses? You are on the
wrong scent altogether. Peter Stockmann. I am not usually that. You must excuse me now if I--
(calls into the dining-room). Good night, Katherine. Good night,
gentlemen. (Goes out.) Mrs. Stockmann (coming from the dining-room). Has he gone? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and in such a bad temper. Mrs. Stockmann. But, dear Thomas, what have you been doing to him again? Dr. Stockmann. Nothing at all. And, anyhow, he can't oblige me to make
my report before the proper time. Mrs. Stockmann. What have you got to make a report to him about? Dr. Stockmann. Hm! Leave that to me, Katherine. It is an extraordinary
thing that the postman doesn't come. (HOVSTAD, BILLING and HORSTER have got up from the table and come into
the sitting-room. EJLIF and MORTEN come in after them.) Billing (stretching himself). Ah!--one feels a new man after a meal
like that. Hovstad. The mayor wasn't in a very sweet temper tonight, then. Dr. Stockmann. It is his stomach; he has wretched digestion. Hovstad. I rather think it was us two of the "People's Messenger" that
he couldn't digest. Mrs. Stockmann. I thought you came out of it pretty well with him. Hovstad. Oh yes; but it isn't anything more than a sort of truce. Billing. That is just what it is! That word sums up the situation. Dr. Stockmann. We must remember that Peter is a lonely man, poor chap. He has no home comforts of any kind; nothing but everlasting business. And all that infernal weak tea wash that he pours into himself! Now
then, my boys, bring chairs up to the table. Aren't we going to have
that toddy, Katherine? Mrs. Stockmann (going into the dining-room). I am just getting it. Dr. Stockmann. Sit down here on the couch beside me, Captain Horster. We so seldom see you. Please sit down, my friends. (They sit down at
the table. MRS. STOCKMANN brings a tray, with a spirit-lamp, glasses,
bottles, etc., upon it.) Mrs. Stockmann. There you are! This is arrack, and this is rum, and
this one is the brandy. Now every one must help themselves. Dr. Stockmann (taking a glass). We will. (They all mix themselves some
toddy.) And let us have the cigars. Ejlif, you know where the box is. And you, Morten, can fetch my pipe. (The two boys go into the room on
the right.) I have a suspicion that Ejlif pockets a cigar now and
then!--but I take no notice of it. (Calls out.) And my smoking-cap too,
Morten. Katherine, you can tell him where I left it. Ah, he has got it. (The boys bring the various things.) Now, my friends. I stick to my
pipe, you know. This one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up
north. (Touches glasses with them.) Your good health! Ah, it is good to
be sitting snug and warm here. Mrs. Stockmann (who sits knitting). Do you sail soon, Captain Horster? Horster. I expect to be ready to sail next week. Mrs. Stockmann. I suppose you are going to America? Horster. Yes, that is the plan. Mrs. Stockmann. Then you won't be able to take part in the coming
election? Horster. Is there going to be an election? Billing. Didn't you know? Horster. No, I don't mix myself up with those things. Billing. But do you not take an interest in public affairs? Horster. No, I don't know anything about politics. Billing. All the same, one ought to vote, at any rate. Horster. Even if one doesn't know anything about what is going on? Billing. Doesn't know! What do you mean by that? A community is like a
ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm. Horster. Maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board ship it
wouldn't work. Hovstad. It is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes
on on shore. Billing. Very extraordinary. Dr. Stockmann. Sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at
home in any latitude. And that is only an additional reason for our
being all the more keen, Hovstad. Is there to be anything of public
interest in tomorrow's "Messenger"? Hovstad. Nothing about municipal affairs. But the day after tomorrow I
was thinking of printing your article--

Dr. Stockmann. Ah, devil take it--my article! Look here, that must wait
a bit. Hovstad. Really? We had just got convenient space for it, and I thought
it was just the opportune moment--

Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, very likely you are right; but it must wait
all the same. I will explain to you later. (PETRA comes in from the
hall, in hat and cloak and with a bundle of exercise books under her
arm.) Petra. Good evening. Dr. Stockmann. Good evening, Petra; come along. (Mutual greetings; PETRA takes off her things and puts them down on a
chair by the door.) Petra. And you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while I
have been out slaving! Dr. Stockmann. Well, come and enjoy yourself too! Billing. May I mix a glass for you? Petra (coming to the table). Thanks, I would rather do it; you always
mix it too strong. But I forgot, father--I have a letter for you. (Goes
to the chair where she has laid her things.) Dr. Stockmann. A letter? From whom? Petra (looking in her coat pocket). The postman gave it to me just as I
was going out. Dr. Stockmann (getting up and going to her). And you only give to me
now! Petra. I really had not time to run up again. There it is! Dr. Stockmann (seizing the letter). Let's see, let's see, child! (Looks
at the address.) Yes, that's all right! Mrs. Stockmann. Is it the one you have been expecting go anxiously,
Thomas? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it is. I must go to my room now and-- Where shall I
get a light, Katherine? Is there no lamp in my room again? Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk. Dr. Stockmann. Good, good. Excuse me for a moment--, (Goes into his
study.) Petra. What do you suppose it is, mother? Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; for the last day or two he has always
been asking if the postman has not been. Billing. Probably some country patient. Petra. Poor old dad!--he will overwork himself soon. (Mixes a glass for
herself.) There, that will taste good! Hovstad. Have you been teaching in the evening school again today? Petra (sipping from her glass). Two hours. Billing. And four hours of school in the morning? Petra. Five hours. Mrs. Stockmann. And you have still got exercises to correct, I see. Petra. A whole heap, yes. Horster. You are pretty full up with work too, it seems to me. Petra. Yes--but that is good. One is so delightfully tired after it. Billing. Do you like that? Petra. Yes, because one sleeps so well then. Morten. You must be dreadfully wicked, Petra. Petra. Wicked? Morten. Yes, because you work so much. Mr. Rorlund says work is a
punishment for our sins. Ejlif. Pooh, what a duffer, you are, to believe a thing like that! Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Ejlif! Billing (laughing). That's capital! Hovstad. Don't you want to work as hard as that, Morten? Morten. No, indeed I don't. Hovstad. What do you want to be, then? Morten. I should like best to be a Viking,

Ejlif. You would have to be a pagan then. Morten. Well, I could become a pagan, couldn't I? Billing. I agree with you, Morten! My sentiments, exactly. Mrs. Stockmann (signalling to him). I am sure that is not true, Mr. Billing. Billing. Yes, I swear it is! I am a pagan, and I am proud of it. Believe me, before long we shall all be pagans. Morten. And then shall be allowed to do anything we like? Billing. Well, you'll see, Morten. Mrs. Stockmann. You must go to your room now, boys; I am sure you have
some lessons to learn for tomorrow. Ejlif. I should like so much to stay a little longer--

Mrs. Stockmann. No, no; away you go, both of you, (The boys say good
night and go into the room on the left.) Hovstad. Do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such
things? Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; but I don't like it. Petra. But you know, mother, I think you really are wrong about it. Mrs. Stockmann. Maybe, but I don't like it--not in our own home. Petra. There is so much falsehood both at home and at school. At home
one must not speak, and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the
children. Horster. Tell lies? Petra. Yes, don't you suppose we have to teach them all sorts of things
that we don't believe? Billing. That is perfectly true. Petra. If only I had the means, I would start a school of my own; and
it would be conducted on very different lines. Billing. Oh, bother the means--! Horster. Well if you are thinking of that, Miss Stockmann, I shall be
delighted to provide you with a schoolroom. The great big old house my
father left me is standing almost empty; there is an immense
dining-room downstairs--

Petra (laughing). Thank you very much; but I am afraid nothing will
come of it. Hovstad. No, Miss Petra is much more likely to take to journalism, I
expect. By the way, have you had time to do anything with that English
story you promised to translate for us? Petra. No, not yet, but you shall have it in good time. (DR. STOCKMANN comes in from his room with an open letter in his hand.) Dr. Stockmann (waving the letter). Well, now the town will have
something new to talk about, I can tell you! Billing. Something new? Mrs. Stockmann. What is this? Dr. Stockmann. A great discovery, Katherine. Hovstad. Really? Mrs. Stockmann. A discovery of yours? Dr. Stockmann. A discovery of mine. (Walks up and down.) Just let them
come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's
imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can
tell you! Petra. But, father, tell us what it is. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes--only give me time, and you shall know all
about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go
about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any
moles--

Hovstad. What are you driving at, Doctor? Dr. Stockmann (standing still by the table). Isn't it the universal
opinion that our town is a healthy spot? Hovstad. Certainly. Dr. Stockmann. Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact--a place that
deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for
invalids or for people who are well--

Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but my dear Thomas--

Dr. Stockmann. And we have been recommending it and praising it--I have
written and written, both in the "Messenger" and in pamphlets...

Hovstad. Well, what then? Dr. Stockmann. And the Baths--we have called them the "main artery of
the town's life-blood," the "nerve-centre of our town," and the devil
knows what else--

Billing. "The town's pulsating heart" was the expression I once used on
an important occasion. Dr. Stockmann. Quite so. Well, do you know what they really are, these
great, splendid, much praised Baths, that have cost so much money--do
you know what they are? Hovstad. No, what are they? Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, what are they? Dr. Stockmann. The whole place is a pest-house! Petra. The Baths, father? Mrs. Stockmann (at the same time), Our Baths? Hovstad. But, Doctor--

Billing. Absolutely incredible! Dr. Stockmann. The whole Bath establishment is a whited, poisoned
sepulchre, I tell you--the gravest possible danger to the public
health! All the nastiness up at Molledal, all that stinking filth, is
infecting the water in the conduit-pipes leading to the reservoir; and
the same cursed, filthy poison oozes out on the shore too--

Horster. Where the bathing-place is? Dr. Stockmann. Just there. Hovstad. How do you come to be so certain of all this, Doctor? Dr. Stockmann. I have investigated the matter most conscientiously. For
a long time past I have suspected something of the kind. Last year we
had some very strange cases of illness among the visitors--typhoid
cases, and cases of gastric fever--

Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is quite true. Dr. Stockmann. At the time, we supposed the visitors had been infected
before they came; but later on, in the winter, I began to have a
different opinion; and so I set myself to examine the water, as well as
I could. Mrs. Stockmann. Then that is what you have been so busy with? Dr. Stockmann. Indeed I have been busy, Katherine. But here I had none
of the necessary scientific apparatus; so I sent samples, both of the
drinking-water and of the sea-water, up to the University, to have an
accurate analysis made by a chemist. Hovstad. And have you got that? Dr. Stockmann (showing him the letter). Here it is! It proves the
presence of decomposing organic matter in the water--it is full of
infusoria. The water is absolutely dangerous to use, either internally
or externally. Mrs. Stockmann. What a mercy you discovered it in time. Dr. Stockmann. You may well say so. Hovstad. And what do you propose to do now, Doctor? Dr. Stockmann. To see the matter put right, naturally. Hovstad. Can that be done? Dr. Stockmann. It must be done. Otherwise the Baths will be absolutely
useless and wasted. But we need not anticipate that; I have a very
clear idea what we shall have to do. Mrs. Stockmann. But why have you kept this all so secret, dear? Dr. Stockmann. Do you suppose I was going to run about the town
gossiping about it, before I had absolute proof? No, thank you. I am
not such a fool. Petra. Still, you might have told us--

Dr. Stockmann. Not a living soul. But tomorrow you may run around to
the old Badger--

Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, Thomas! Thomas! Dr. Stockmann. Well, to your grandfather, then. The old boy will have
something to be astonished at! I know he thinks I am cracked--and there
are lots of other people who think so too, I have noticed. But now
these good folks shall see--they shall just see! (Walks about, rubbing
his hands.) There will be a nice upset in the town, Katherine; you
can't imagine what it will be. All the conduit-pipes will have to be
relaid. Hovstad (getting up). All the conduit-pipes--? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, of course. The intake is too low down; it will have
to be lifted to a position much higher up. Petra. Then you were right after all. Dr. Stockmann. Ah, you remember, Petra--I wrote opposing the plans
before the work was begun. But at that time no one would listen to me. Well, I am going to let them have it now. Of course I have prepared a
report for the Baths Committee; I have had it ready for a week, and was
only waiting for this to come. (Shows the letter.) Now it shall go off
at once. (Goes into his room and comes back with some papers.) Look at
that! Four closely written sheets!--and the letter shall go with them. Give me a bit of paper, Katherine--something to wrap them up in. That
will do! Now give it to-to-(stamps his foot)--what the deuce is her
name?--give it to the maid, and tell her to take it at once to the
Mayor. (Mrs. Stockmann takes the packet and goes out through the dining-room.) Petra. What do you think Uncle Peter will say, father? Dr. Stockmann. What is there for him to say? I should think he would be
very glad that such an important truth has been brought to light. Hovstad. Will you let me print a short note about your discovery in the
"Messenger?" Dr. Stockmann. I shall be very much obliged if you will. Hovstad. It is very desirable that the public should be informed of it
without delay. Dr. Stockmann. Certainly. Mrs. Stockmann (coming back). She has just gone with it. Billing. Upon my soul, Doctor, you are going to be the foremost man in
the town! Dr. Stockmann (walking about happily). Nonsense! As a matter of
fact I have done nothing more than my duty. I have only made a lucky
find--that's all. Still, all the same... Billing. Hovstad, don't you think the town ought to give Dr. Stockmann
some sort of testimonial? Hovstad. I will suggest it, anyway. Billing. And I will speak to Aslaksen about it. Dr. Stockmann. No, my good friends, don't let us have any of that
nonsense. I won't hear anything of the kind. And if the Baths Committee
should think of voting me an increase of salary, I will not accept it. Do you hear, Katherine?--I won't accept it. Mrs. Stockmann. You are quite right, Thomas. Petra (lifting her glass). Your health, father! Hovstad and Billing. Your health, Doctor! Good health! Horster (touches glasses with DR. STOCKMANN). I hope it will bring you
nothing but good luck. Dr. Stockmann. Thank you, thank you, my dear fellows! I feel
tremendously happy! It is a splendid thing for a man to be able to feel
that he has done a service to his native town and to his
fellow-citizens. Hurrah, Katherine! (He puts his arms round her and
whirls her round and round, while she protests with laughing cries. They all laugh, clap their hands, and cheer the DOCTOR. The boys put
their heads in at the door to see what is going on.) ACT II


(SCENE,--The same. The door into the dining room is shut. It is
morning. MRS. STOCKMANN, with a sealed letter in her hand, comes in
from the dining room, goes to the door of the DOCTOR'S study, and peeps
in.) Mrs. Stockmann. Are you in, Thomas? Dr. Stockmann (from within his room). Yes, I have just come in. (Comes
into the room.) What is it? Mrs. Stockmann. A letter from your brother. Dr. Stockmann. Aha, let us see! (Opens the letter and reads:) "I return
herewith the manuscript you sent me" (reads on in a low murmur) H'm!--

Mrs. Stockmann. What does he say? Dr. Stockmann (putting the papers in his pocket). Oh, he only writes
that he will come up here himself about midday. Mrs. Stockmann. Well, try and remember to be at home this time. Dr. Stockmann. That will be all right; I have got through all my
morning visits. Mrs. Stockmann. I am extremely curious to know how he takes it. Dr. Stockmann. You will see he won't like it's having been I, and not
he, that made the discovery. Mrs. Stockmann. Aren't you a little nervous about that? Dr. Stockmann. Oh, he really will be pleased enough, you know. But, at
the same time, Peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyone's doing any
service to the town except himself. Mrs. Stockmann. I will tell you what, Thomas--you should be good
natured, and share the credit of this with him. Couldn't you make out
that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery? Dr. Stockmann. I am quite willing. If only I can get the thing set
right. I--

(MORTEN KIIL puts his head in through the door leading from the hall,
looks around in an enquiring manner, and chuckles.) Morten Kiil (slyly). Is it--is it true? Mrs. Stockmann (going to the door). Father!--is it you? Dr. Stockmann. Ah, Mr. Kiil--good morning, good morning! Mrs. Stockmann. But come along in. Morten Kiil. If it is true, I will; if not, I am off. Dr. Stockmann. If what is true? Morten Kiil. This tale about the water supply, is it true? Dr. Stockmann. Certainly it is true, but how did you come to hear it? Morten Kid (coming in). Petra ran in on her way to the school--

Dr. Stockmann. Did she? Morten Kiil. Yes; and she declares that--I thought she was only making
a fool of me--but it isn't like Petra to do that. Dr. Stockmann. Of course not. How could you imagine such a thing! Morten Kiil. Oh well, it is better never to trust anybody; you may find
you have been made a fool of before you know where you are. But it is
really true, all the same? Dr. Stockmann. You can depend upon it that it is true. Won't you sit
down? (Settles him on the couch.) Isn't it a real bit of luck for the
town--

Morten Kiil (suppressing his laughter). A bit of luck for the town? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that I made the discovery in good time. Morten Kiil (as before). Yes, yes, Yes!--But I should never have
thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this! Dr. Stockmann. Pull his leg! Mrs. Stockmann. Really, father dear--

Morten Kiil (resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick
and winking slyly at the DOCTOR). Let me see, what was the story? Some
kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it? Dr. Stockmann. Infusoria--yes. Morten Kiil. And a lot of these beasts had got in, according to
Petra--a tremendous lot. Dr. Stockmann. Certainly; hundreds of thousands of them, probably. Morten Kiil. But no one can see them--isn't that so? Dr. Stockmann. Yes; you can't see them,

Morten Kiil (with a quiet chuckle). Damn--it's the finest story I have
ever heard! Dr. Stockmann. What do you mean? Morten Kiil. But you will never get the Mayor to believe a thing like
that. Dr. Stockmann. We shall see. Morten Kiil. Do you think he will be fool enough to--? Dr. Stockmann. I hope the whole town will be fools enough. Morten Kiil. The whole town! Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing. It would
just serve them right, and teach them a lesson. They think themselves
so much cleverer than we old fellows. They hounded me out of the
council; they did, I tell you--they hounded me out. Now they shall pay
for it. You pull their legs too, Thomas! Dr. Stockmann. Really, I--

Morten Kiil. You pull their legs! (Gets up.) If you can work it so that
the Mayor and his friends all swallow the same bait, I will give ten
pounds to a charity--like a shot! Dr. Stockmann. That is very kind of you. Morten Kiil. Yes, I haven't got much money to throw away, I can tell
you; but, if you can work this, I will give five pounds to a charity at
Christmas. (HOVSTAD comes in by the hall door.) Hovstad. Good morning! (Stops.) Oh, I beg your pardon

Dr. Stockmann. Not at all; come in. Morten Kiil (with another chuckle). Oho!--is he in this too? Hovstad. What do you mean? Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he is. Morten Kiil. I might have known it! It must get into the papers. You
know how to do it, Thomas! Set your wits to work. Now I must go. Dr. Stockmann. Won't you stay a little while? Morten Kiil. No, I must be off now. You keep up this game for all it is
worth; you won't repent it, I'm damned if you will! (He goes out; MRS. STOCKMANN follows him into the hall.) Dr. Stockmann (laughing). Just imagine--the old chap doesn't believe a
word of all this about the water supply. Hovstad. Oh that was it, then? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, that was what we were talking about. Perhaps it is
the same thing that brings you here? Hovstad. Yes, it is, Can you spare me a few minutes, Doctor? Dr. Stockmann. As long as you like, my dear fellow. Hovstad. Have you heard from the Mayor yet? Dr. Stockmann. Not yet. He is coming here later. Hovstad. I have given the matter a great deal of thought since last
night. Dr. Stockmann. Well? Hovstad. From your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science,
this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. I mean, you do
not realise that it involves a great many other things. Dr. Stockmann. How, do you mean?--Let us sit down, my dear fellow. No,
sit here on the couch. (HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch, DR. STOCKMANN
On a chair on the other side of the table.) Now then. You mean that--? Hovstad. You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to
impurities in the soil. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass
up at Molledal. Hovstad. Begging your pardon, Doctor, I fancy it is due to quite
another morass altogether. Dr. Stockmann. What morass? Hovstad. The morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is
rotting in. Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce are you driving at, Hovstad? Hovstad. The whole of the town's interests have, little by little, got
into the hands of a pack of officials. Dr. Stockmann. Oh, come!--they are not all officials. Hovstad. No, but those that are not officials are at any rate the
officials' friends and adherents; it is the wealthy folk, the old
families in the town, that have got us entirely in their hands. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, but after all they are men of ability and knowledge. Hovstad.
